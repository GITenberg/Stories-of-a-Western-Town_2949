    <h2>
      THE BESETMENT OF KURT LIEDERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      A SILVER rime glistened all down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a drabble of dead leaves on the sidewalk which was of wood, and
      on the roadway which was of macadam and stiff mud. The wind blew sharply,
      for it was a December day and only six in the morning. Nor were the houses
      high enough to furnish any independent bulwark; they were low, wooden
      dwellings, the tallest a bare two stories in height, the majority only one
      story. But they were in good painting and repair, and most of them had a
      homely gayety of geraniums or bouvardias in the windows. The house on the
      corner was the tall house. It occupied a larger yard than its neighbors;
      and there were lace curtains tied with blue ribbons for the windows in the
      right hand front room. The door of this house swung back with a crash, and
      a woman darted out. She ran at the top of her speed to the little yellow
      house farther down the street. Her blue calico gown clung about her stout
      figure and fluttered behind her, revealing her blue woollen stockings and
      felt slippers. Her gray head was bare. As she ran tears rolled down her
      cheeks and she wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, lieber Herr Je!&rdquo; One near would have heard her sob, in
      too distracted agitation to heed the motorneer of the passing street-car
      who stared after her at the risk of his car, or the tousled heads behind a
      few curtains. She did not stop until she almost fell against the door of
      the yellow house. Her frantic knocking was answered by a young woman in a
      light and artless costume of a quilted petticoat and a red flannel sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gracious goodness! Mrs. Lieders!&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thekla Lieders rather staggered than walked into the room and fell back on
      the black haircloth sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, there,&rdquo; said the young woman while she patted the broad
      shoulders heaving between sobs and short breath, &ldquo;what is it? The house
      aint afire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, oh, Mrs. Olsen, he has done it again!&rdquo; She wailed in sobs, like a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done it? Done what?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Olsen, then her face paled. &ldquo;Oh, my
      gracious, you DON'T mean he's killed himself&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's killed himself, again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's dead?&rdquo; asked the other in an awed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lieders gulped down her tears. &ldquo;Oh, not so bad as that, I cut him
      down, he was up in the garret and I sus&mdash;suspected him and I run up
      and&mdash;oh, he was there, a choking, and he was so mad! He swore at me
      and&mdash;he kicked me when I&mdash;I says: 'Kurt, what are you doing of?
      Hold on till I git a knife,' I says&mdash;for his hands was just dangling
      at his side; and he says nottings cause he couldn't, he was most gone, and
      I knowed I wouldn't have time to git no knife but I saw it was a rope was
      pretty bad worn and so&mdash;so I just run and jumped and ketched it in my
      hands, and being I'm so fleshy it couldn't stand no more and it broke!
      And, oh! he&mdash;he kicked me when I was try to come near to git the rope
      off his neck; and so soon like he could git his breath he swore at me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you a helping of him! Just listen to that!&rdquo; cried the hearer
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I come here for to git you and Mr. Olsen to help me git him down
      stairs, 'cause he is too heavy for me to lift, and he is so mad he won't
      walk down himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course. I'll call Carl. Carl! dost thou hear? come! But did
      you dare to leave him Mrs. Lieders?&rdquo; Part of the time she spoke in
      English, part of the time in her own tongue, gliding from one to another,
      and neither party observing the transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lieders wiped her eyes, saying: &ldquo;Oh, yes, Danke schon, I aint afraid
      'cause I tied him with the rope, righd good, so he don't got no chance to
      move. He was make faces at me all the time I tied him.&rdquo; At the
      remembrance, the tears welled anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Olsen, a little bright tinted woman with a nose too small for her big
      blue eyes and chubby cheeks, quivered with indignant sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did nefer hear of sooch a mean acting man!&rdquo; seemed to her the
      most natural expression; but the wife fired, at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is not a mean man,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;no, Freda Olsen, he is not a mean
      man at all! There aint nowhere a better man than my man; and Carl Olsen,
      he knows that. Kurt, he always buys a whole ham and a whole barrel of
      flour, and never less than a dollar of sugar at a time! And he never gits
      drunk nor he never gives me any bad talk. It was only he got this wanting
      to kill himself on him, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I'll go put on my things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Olsen, wisely
      declining to defend her position. &ldquo;You set right still and warm yourself,
      and we'll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was hardly more than that time before both Carl Olsen, who
      worked in the same furniture factory as Kurt Lieders, and was a comely and
      after-witted giant, appeared with Mrs. Olsen ready for the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded at Mrs. Lieders and made a gurgling noise in his throat,
      expected to convey sympathy. Then, he coughed and said that he was ready,
      and they started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling further expression demanded, Mrs. Olsen asked: &ldquo;How many times has
      he done it, Mrs. Lieders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lieders was trotting along, her anxious eyes on the house in the
      distance, especially on the garret windows. &ldquo;Three times,&rdquo; she answered,
      not removing her eyes; &ldquo;onct he tooked Rough on Rats and I found it out
      and I put some apple butter in the place of it, and he kept wondering and
      wondering how he didn't feel notings, and after awhile I got him off the
      notion, that time. He wasn't mad at me; he just said: 'Well, I do it some
      other time. You see!' but he promised to wait till I got the spring house
      cleaning over, so he could shake the carpets for me; and by and by he got
      feeling better. He was mad at the boss and that made him feel bad. The
      next time it was the same, that time he jumped into the cistern&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Olsen, with a half grin, &ldquo;I pulled him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the razor he wanted,&rdquo; the wife continued, &ldquo;and when he come home
      and says he was going to leave the shop and he aint never going back
      there, and gets out his razor and sharps it, I knowed what that meant and
      I told him I got to have some bluing and wouldn't he go and get it? and he
      says, 'You won't git another husband run so free on your errands, Thekla,'
      and I says I don't want none; and when he was gone I hid the razor and he
      couldn't find it, but that didn't mad him, he didn't say notings; and when
      I went to git the supper he walked out in the yard and jumped into the
      cistern, and I heard the splash and looked in and there he was trying to
      git his head under, and I called, 'For the Lord's sake, papa! For the
      Lord's sake!' just like that. And I fished for him with the pole that
      stood there and he was sorry and caught hold of it and give in, and I
      rested the pole agin the side cause I wasn't strong enough to h'ist him
      out; and he held on whilest I run for help&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I got the ladder and he clum out,&rdquo; said the giant with another grin
      of recollection, &ldquo;he was awful wet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a month ago,&rdquo; said the wife, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sharped the razor onct,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lieders, &ldquo;but he said it was for to
      shave him, and I got him to promise to let the barber shave him sometime,
      instead. Here, Mrs. Olsen, you go righd in, the door aint locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were at the house door. They passed in and ascended the
      stairs to the second story, then climbed a narrow, ladder-like flight to
      the garret. Involuntarily they had paused to listen at the foot of the
      stairs, but it was very quiet, not a sound of movement, not so much as the
      sigh of a man breathing. The wife turned pale and put both her shaking
      hands on her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he's trying to scare us by keeping quiet!&rdquo; said Olsen, cheerfully,
      and he stumbled up the stairs, in advance. &ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; he exclaimed, on the
      last stair, &ldquo;well, we aint any too quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact Carl had nearly fallen over the master of the house, that
      enterprising self-destroyer having contrived, pinioned as he was, to roll
      over to the very brink of the stair well, with the plain intent to break
      his neck by plunging headlong.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dim light all that they could see was a small, old man whose white
      hair was strung in wisps over his purple face, whose deep set eyes glared
      like the eyes of a rat in a trap, and whose very elbows and knees
      expressed in their cramps the fury of an outraged soul. When he saw the
      new-comers he shut his eyes and his jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Lieders,&rdquo; said Olsen, mildly, &ldquo;I guess you better git
      down-stairs. Kin I help you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lieders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I give you an arm to lean on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you go at all, Mr. Lieders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olsen shook his head. &ldquo;I hate to trouble you, Mr. Lieders,&rdquo; said he in his
      slow, undecided tones, &ldquo;please excuse me,&rdquo; with which he gathered up the
      little man into his strong arms and slung him over his shoulders, as
      easily as he would sling a sack of meal. It was a vent for Mrs. Olsen's
      bubbling indignation to make a dive for Lieders's heels and hold them,
      while Carl backed down-stairs. But Lieders did not make the least
      resistance. He allowed them to carry him into the room indicated by his
      wife, and to lay him bound on the plump feather bed. It was not his
      bedroom but the sacred &ldquo;spare room,&rdquo; and the bed was part of its luxury.
      Thekla ran in, first, to remove the embroidered pillow shams and the
      dazzling, silken &ldquo;crazy quilt&rdquo; that was her choicest possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safely in the bed, Lieders opened his eyes and looked from one face to the
      other, his lip curling. &ldquo;You can't keep me this way all the time. I can do
      it in spite of you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you had ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Lieders!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Olsen burst out, in a tremble between wrath and exertion, shaking her
      little, plump fist at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the placid Carl only nodded, as in sympathy, saying, &ldquo;Well, I am sorry
      you feel so bad, Mr. Lieders. I guess we got to go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Olsen looked as if she would have liked to exhort Lieders further;
      but she shrugged her shoulders and followed her husband in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished you'd stay to breakfast, now you're here,&rdquo; Thekla urged out of
      her imperious hospitality; had Kurt been lying there dead, the next meal
      must have been offered, just the same. &ldquo;I know, you aint got time to git
      Mr. Olsen his breakfast, Freda, before he has got to go to the shops, and
      my tea-kettle is boiling now, and the coffee'll be ready&mdash;I GUESS you
      had better stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Olsen seconded her husband's denial, and there was nothing left
      Thekla but to see them to the door. No sooner did she return than Lieders
      spoke. &ldquo;Aint you going to take off them ropes?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you promise you won't do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence. Thekla, brushing a few tears from her eyes, scrutinized the ropes
      again, before she walked heavily out of the room. She turned the key in
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly a savory steam floated through the hall and pierced the cracks
      about the door; then Thekla's footsteps returned; they echoed over the
      uncarpeted boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought his breakfast, cooked with the best of her homely skill.
      The pork chops that he liked had been fried, there was a napkin on the
      tray, and the coffee was in the best gilt cup and saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your breakfast, papa,&rdquo; said she, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want no breakfast,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, holding the tray, and wistfully eying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it 'way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I won't touch it if you stand till doomsday,
      lessen you untie me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll untie your arm, papa, one arm; you kin eat that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not lessen you untie all of me, I won't touch a bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why I won't untie you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving will kill as dead as hanging,&rdquo; was Lieders's orphic response to
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thekla sighed and went away, leaving the tray on the table. It may be that
      she hoped the sight of food might stir his stomach to rebel against his
      dogged will; if so she was disappointed; half an hour went by during which
      the statue under the bedclothes remained without so much as a quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old woman returned. &ldquo;Aint you awful cramped and stiff, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise not to do yourself a mischief, if I untie you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thekla groaned, while the tears started to her red eyelids. &ldquo;But you'll
      git awful tired and it will hurt you if you don't get the ropes off, soon,
      papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes again, to be the less hindered from dropping back into
      his distempered musings. Thekla took a seat by his side and sat silent as
      he. Slowly the natural pallor returned to the high forehead and sharp
      features. They were delicate features and there was an air of refinement,
      of thought, about Lieders's whole person, as different as possible from
      the robust comeliness of his wife. With its keen sensitive-ness and its
      undefined melancholy it was a dreamer's face. One meets such faces,
      sometimes, in incongruous places and wonders what they mean. In fact, Kurt
      Lieders, head cabinet maker in the furniture factory of Lossing &amp; Co.,
      was an artist. He was, also, an incomparable artisan and the most exacting
      foreman in the shops. Thirty years ago he had first taken wages from the
      senior Lossing. He had watched a modest industry climb up to a great
      business, nor was he all at sea in his own estimate of his share in the
      firm's success. Lieders's workmanship had an honesty, an infinite patience
      of detail, a daring skill of design that came to be sought and commanded
      its own price. The Lossing &ldquo;art furniture&rdquo; did not slander the name. No
      sculptor ever wrought his soul into marble with a more unflinching
      conscience or a purer joy in his work than this wood-carver dreaming over
      sideboards and bedsteads. Unluckily, Lieders had the wrong side of the
      gift as well as the right; was full of whims and crotchets, and as
      unpractical as the Christian martyrs. He openly defied expense, and he
      would have no trifling with the laws of art. To make after orders was an
      insult to Kurt. He made what was best for the customer; if the latter had
      not the sense to see it he was a fool and a pig, and some one else should
      work for him, not Kurt Lieders, BEGEHR!
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Lossing had learned the business practically. He was taught the
      details by his father's best workman; and a mighty hard and strict master
      the best workman proved! Lossing did not dream that the crabbed old tyrant
      who rarely praised him, who made him go over, for the twentieth time, any
      imperfect piece of work, who exacted all the artisan virtues to the last
      inch, was secretly proud of him. Yet, in fact, the thread of romance in
      Lieders's prosaic life was his idolatry of the Lossing Manufacturing Co.
      It is hard to tell whether it was the Lossings or that intangible
      quantity, the firm, the business, that he worshipped. Worship he did,
      however, the one or the other, perhaps the both of them, though in the
      peevish and erratic manner of the savage who sometimes grovels to his
      idols and sometimes kicks them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody guessed what a blow it was to Kurt when, a year ago, the elder
      Lossing had died. Even his wife did not connect his sullen melancholy and
      his gibes at the younger generation, with the crape on Harry Lossing's
      hat. He would not go to the funeral, but worked savagely, all alone by
      himself, in the shop, the whole afternoon&mdash;breaking down at last at
      the sight of a carved panel over which Lossing and he had once disputed.
      The desolate loneliness of the old came to him when his old master was
      gone. He loved the young man, but the old man was of his own generation;
      he had &ldquo;known how things ought to be and he could understand without
      talking.&rdquo; Lieders began to be on the lookout for signs of waning
      consideration, to watch his own eyes and hands, drearily wondering when
      they would begin to play him false; at the same time because he was
      unhappy he was ten times as exacting and peremptory and critical with the
      younger workmen, and ten times as insolently independent with the young
      master. Often enough, Lossing was exasperated to the point of taking the
      old man at his word and telling him to go if he would, but every time the
      chain of long habit, a real respect for such faithful service, and a keen
      admiration for Kurt's matchless skill in his craft, had held him back. He
      prided himself on keeping his word; for that reason he was warier of using
      it. So he would compromise by giving the domineering old fellow a &ldquo;good,
      stiff rowing.&rdquo; Once, he coupled this with a threat, if they could not get
      along decently they would better part! Lieders had answered not a word; he
      had given Lossing a queer glance and turned on his heel. He went home and
      bought some poison on the way. &ldquo;The old man is gone and the young feller
      don't want the old crank round, no more,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Thekla, I
      guess I make her troubles, too; I'll git out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the beginning of his tampering with suicide. Thekla, who did not
      have the same opinion of the &ldquo;trouble,&rdquo; had interfered. He had married
      Thekla to have someone to keep a warm fireside for him, but she was an
      ignorant creature who never could be made to understand about carving. He
      felt sorry for her when the baby died, the only child they ever had; he
      was sorrier than he expected to be on his own account, too, for it was an
      ugly little creature, only four days old, and very red and wrinkled; but
      he never thought of confiding his own griefs or trials to her. Now, it
      made him angry to have that stupid Thekla keep him in a world where he did
      not wish to stay. If the next day Lossing had not remembered how his
      father valued Lieders, and made an excuse to half apologize to him, I fear
      Thekla's stratagems would have done little good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next experience was cut out of the same piece of cloth. He had
      relented, he had allowed his wife to save him; but he was angry in secret.
      Then came the day when open disobedience to Lossing's orders had snapped
      the last thread of Harry's patience. To Lieders's aggrieved &ldquo;If you ain't
      satisfied with my work, Mr. Lossing, I kin quit,&rdquo; the answer had come
      instantly, &ldquo;Very well, Lieders, I'm sorry to lose you, but we can't have
      two bosses here: you can go to the desk.&rdquo; And when Lieders in a blind stab
      of temper had growled a prophecy that Lossing would regret it, Lossing had
      stabbed in turn: &ldquo;Maybe, but it will be a cold day when I ask you to come
      back.&rdquo; And he had gone off without so much as a word of regret. The old
      workman had packed up his tools, the pet tools that no one was ever
      permitted to touch, and crammed his arms into his coat and walked out of
      the place where he had worked so long, not a man saying a word. Lieders
      didn't reflect that they knew nothing of the quarrel. He glowered at them
      and went away sore at heart. We make a great mistake when we suppose that
      it is only the affectionate that desire affection; sulky and
      ill-conditioned souls often have a passionate longing for the very
      feelings that they repel. Lieders was a womanish, sensitive creature under
      the surly mask, and he was cut to the quick by his comrades' apathy.
      &ldquo;There ain't no place for old men in this world,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;there's
      them boys I done my best to make do a good job, and some of 'em I've
      worked overtime to help; and not one of 'em has got as much as a good-by
      in him for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not think of going to poor Thekla for comfort, he went to his
      grim dreams. &ldquo;I git my property all straight for Thekla, and then I quit,&rdquo;
       said he. Perhaps he gave himself a reprieve unconsciously, thinking that
      something might happen to save him from himself. Nothing happened. None of
      the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; came to see him, except Carl Olsen, the very stupidest man in
      the shop, who put Lieders beside himself fifty times a day. The other men
      were sorry that Lieders had gone, having a genuine workman's admiration
      for his skill, and a sort of underground liking for the unreasonable old
      man because he was so absolutely honest and &ldquo;a fellow could always tell
      where to find him.&rdquo; But they were shy, they were afraid he would take
      their pity in bad part, they &ldquo;waited a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carl, honest soul, stood about in Lieders's workshop, kicking the shavings
      with his heels for half an hour, and grinned sheepishly, and was told what
      a worthless, scamping, bragging lot the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; at Lossing's were, and said
      he guessed he had got to go home now; and so departed, unwitting that his
      presence had been a consolation. Mrs. Olsen asked Carl what Lieders said;
      Carl answered simply, &ldquo;Say, Freda, that man feels terrible bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Thekla seemed easily satisfied. She made no outcry as Lieders
      had dreaded, over his leaving the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, papa, you don't need git up so early in the morning no more,
      if you aint going to the shop,&rdquo; was her only comment; and Lieders despised
      the mind of woman more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that evening, while Lieders was down town (occupied, had she known it,
      with a codicil to his will), she went over to the Olsens and found out all
      Carl could tell her about the trouble in the shop. And it was she that
      made the excuse of marketing to go out the next day, that she might see
      the rich widow on the hill who was talking about a china closet, and Judge
      Trevor, who had asked the price of a mantel, and Mr. Martin, who had
      looked at sideboards (all this information came from honest Carl); and who
      proposed to them that they order such furniture of the best cabinet-maker
      in the country, now setting up on his own account. He, simple as a baby
      for all his doggedness, thought that they came because of his fame as a
      workman, and felt a glow of pride, particularly as (having been prepared
      by the wife, who said, &ldquo;You see it don't make so much difference with my
      Kurt 'bout de prize, if so he can get the furniture like he wants it, and
      he always know of the best in the old country&rdquo;) they all were duly humble.
      He accepted a few orders and went to work with a will; he would show them
      what the old man could do. But it was only a temporary gleam; in a little
      while he grew homesick for the shop, for the sawdust floor and the
      familiar smell of oil, and the picture of Lossing flitting in and out. He
      missed the careless young workmen at whom he had grumbled, he missed the
      whir of machinery, and the consciousness of rush and hurry accented by the
      cars on the track outside. In short, he missed the feeling of being part
      of a great whole. At home, in his cosey little improvised shop, there was
      none to dispute him, but there was none to obey him either. He grew
      deathly tired of it all. He got into the habit of walking around the shops
      at night, prowling about his old haunts like a cat. Once the night
      watchman saw him. The next day there was a second watchman engaged. And
      Olsen told him very kindly, meaning only to warn him, that he was
      suspected to be there for no good purpose. Lieders confirmed a lurking
      suspicion of the good Carl's own, by the clouding of his face. Yet he
      would have chopped his hand off rather than have lifted it against the
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Tuesday night, this was Wednesday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of it all, the cruel sense of injustice, returned with such
      poignant force that Lieders groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, Thekla was bending over him. He did not know whether to laugh
      at her or to swear, for she began fumbling at the ropes, half sobbing.
      &ldquo;Yes, I knowed they was hurting you, papa; I'm going to loose one arm.
      Then I put it back again and loose the other. Please don't be bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no resistance and she was as good as her word. She unbound and
      bound him in sections, as it were; he watching her with a morose smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left the room, but only to return with some hot coffee. Lieders
      twisted his head away. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don't eat none of that breakfast,
      not if you make fresh coffee all the morning; I feel like I don't eat
      never no more on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thekla knew that the obstinate nature that she tempted was proof against
      temptation; if Kurt chose to starve, starve he would with food at his
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; she cried, helplessly, &ldquo;what IS the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just dying is the matter with me, Thekla. If I can't die one way I kin
      another. Now Thekla, I want you to quit crying and listen. After I'm gone
      you go to the boss, young Mr. Lossing&mdash;but I always called him Harry
      because he learned his trade of me, Thekla, but he don't think of that now&mdash;and
      you tell him old Lieders that worked for him thirty years is dead, but he
      didn't hold no hard feelings, he knowed he done wrong 'bout that mantel.
      Mind you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; said Thekla, which was a surprise to Kurt; he had dreaded a
      weak flood of tears and protestations. But there were no tears, no
      protestations, only a long look at him and a contraction of the eyebrows
      as if Thekla were trying to think of something that eluded her. She placed
      the coffee on the tray beside the other breakfast. For a while the room
      was very still. Lieders could not see the look of resolve that finally
      smoothed the perplexed lines out of his wife's kind, simple old face. She
      rose. &ldquo;Kurt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don't guess you remember this is our
      wedding-day; it was this day, eighteen year we was married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Lieders, &ldquo;well, I was a bad bargain to you, Thekla; after you
      nursed your father that was a cripple for twenty years, I thought it would
      be easy with me; but I was a bad bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord knows best about that,&rdquo; said Thekla, simply, &ldquo;be it how it be,
      you are the only man I ever had or will have, and I don't like you starve
      yourself. Papa, say you don't kill yourself, to-day, and dat you will eat
      your breakfast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lieders repeated in German, &ldquo;a bad bargain for thee, that is sure.
      But thou hast been a good bargain for me. Here! I promise. Not this day.
      Give me the coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seasons, all the morning, of wondering over his meekness, and his
      agreement to be tied up again, at night. But still, what did a day matter?
      a man humors women's notions; and starving was so tedious. Between whiles
      he elaborated a scheme to attain his end. How easy to outwit the silly
      Thekla! His eyes shone, as he hid the little, sharp knife up his cuff.
      &ldquo;Let her tie me!&rdquo; says Lieders, &ldquo;I keep my word. To-morrow I be out of
      this. He won't git a man like me, pretty soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thekla went about her daily tasks, with her every-day air; but, now and
      again, that same pucker of thought returned to her forehead; and, more
      than once, Lieders saw her stand over some dish, poising her spoon in air,
      too abstracted to notice his cynical observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was more elaborate than common, and Thekla had broached a
      bottle of her currant wine. She gravely drank Lieders's health. &ldquo;And many
      good days, papa,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieders felt a queer movement of pity. After the table was cleared, he
      helped his wife to wash and wipe the dishes as his custom was of a Sunday
      or holiday. He wiped dishes as he did everything, neatly, slowly, with a
      careful deliberation. Not until the dishes were put away and the couple
      were seated, did Thekla speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kurt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I got to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An inarticulate groan and a glance at the door from Lieders. &ldquo;I just got
      to, papa. It aint righd for you to do the way you been doing for so long
      time; efery little whiles you try to kill yourself; no, papa, that aint
      righd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kurt, who had gotten out his pencils and compasses and other drawing
      tools, grunted: &ldquo;I got to look at my work, Thekla, now; I am too busy to
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Kurt, no, papa&rdquo;&mdash;the hands holding the blue apron that she was
      embroidering with white linen began to tremble; Lieders had not the least
      idea what a strain it was on this reticent, slow of speech woman who had
      stood in awe of him for eighteen years, to discuss the horror of her life;
      but he could not help marking her agitation. She went on, desperately:
      &ldquo;Yes, papa, I got to talk it oud with you. You had ought to listen, 'cause
      I always been a good wife to you and nefer refused you notings. No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I aint saying I done it 'cause you been bad to me; everybody knows
      we aint had no trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But everybody what don't know us, when they read how you tried to kill
      yourself in the papers, they think it was me. That always is so. And now I
      never can any more sleep nights, for you is always maybe git up and do
      something to yourself. So now, I got to talk to you, papa. Papa, how could
      you done so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieders twisted his feet under the rungs of his chair; he opened his
      mouth, but only to shut it again with a click of his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got my mind made up, papa. I tought and I tought. I know WHY you done
      it; you done it 'cause you and the boss was mad at each other. The boss
      hadn't no righd to let you go&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he had, I madded him first; I was a fool. Of course I knowed more
      than him 'bout the work, but I hadn't no right to go against him. The boss
      is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa, I got my mind made up&rdquo;&mdash;like most sluggish spirits there
      was an immense momentum about Thekla's mind, once get it fairly started it
      was not to be diverted&mdash;&ldquo;you never killed yourself before you used to
      git mad at the boss. You was afraid he would send you away; and now you
      have sent yourself away you don't want to live, 'cause you do not know how
      you can git along without the shop. But you want to get back, you want to
      get back more as you want to kill yourself. Yes, papa, I know, I know
      where you did used to go, nights. Now&rdquo;&mdash;she changed her speech
      unconsciously to the tongue of her youth&mdash;&ldquo;it is not fair, it is not
      fair to me that thou shouldst treat me like that, thou dost belong to me,
      also; so I say, my Kurt, wilt thou make a bargain with me? If I shall get
      thee back thy place wilt thou promise me never to kill thyself any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieders had not once looked up at her during the slow, difficult sentences
      with their half choked articulation; but he was experiencing some strange
      emotions, and one of them was a novel respect for his wife. All he said
      was: &ldquo;'Taint no use talking. I won't never ask him to take me back, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you aint asking of him. <i>I</i> ask him. I try to git you back,
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it aint no use; I know the boss, he aint going to be letting
      womans talk him over; no, he's a good man, he knows how to work his
      business himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would you promise me, Kurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieders's eyes blurred with a mild and dreamy mist; he sighed softly.
      &ldquo;Thekla, you can't see how it is. It is like you are tied up, if I don't
      can do that; if I can then it is always that I am free, free to go, free
      to stay. And for you, Thekla, it is the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thekla's mild eyes flashed. &ldquo;I don't believe you would like it so you wake
      up in the morning and find ME hanging up in the kitchen by the
      clothes-line!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieders had the air of one considering deeply. Then he gave Thekla one of
      the surprises of her life; he rose from his chair, he walked in his
      shuffling, unheeled slippers across the room to where the old woman sat;
      he put one arm on the back of the chair and stiffly bent over her and
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieber Herr Je!&rdquo; gasped Thekla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall go, too, pretty quick, that is all, mamma,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thekla wiped her eyes. A little pause fell between them, and in it they
      may have both remembered vanished, half-forgotten days when life had
      looked differently to them, when they had never thought to sit by their
      own fireside and discuss suicide. The husband spoke first; with a
      reluctant, half-shamed smile, &ldquo;Thekla, I tell you what, I make the bargain
      with you; you git me back that place, I don't do it again, 'less you let
      me; you don't git me back that place, you don't say notings to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apron dropped from the withered, brown hands to the floor. Again there
      was silence; but not for long; ghastly as was the alternative, the
      proposal offered a chance to escape from the terror that was sapping her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will you give me, papa?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you a week,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thekla rose and went to the door; as she opened it a fierce gust of wind
      slashed her like a knife, and Lieders exclaimed, fretfully, &ldquo;what you
      opening that door for, Thekla, letting in the wind? I'm so cold, now,
      right by the fire, I most can't draw. We got to keep a fire in the
      base-burner good, all night, or the plants will freeze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thekla said confusedly that something sounded like a cat crying. &ldquo;And you
      talking like that it frightened me; maybe I was wrong to make such
      bargains&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't make it,&rdquo; said Lieders, curtly, &ldquo;I aint asking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Thekla drew a long breath and straightened herself, saying, &ldquo;Yes, I
      make it, papa, I make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, put another stick of wood in the stove, will you, now you are up?&rdquo;
       said Lieders, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;or I'll freeze in spite of you! It
      seems to me it grows colder every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all that day he was unusually gentle with Thekla. He talked of his
      youth and the struggles of the early days of the firm; he related a dozen
      tales of young Lossing, all illustrating some admirable trait that he
      certainly had not praised at the time. Never had he so opened his heart in
      regard to his own ideals of art, his own ambitions. And Thekla listened,
      not always comprehending but always sympathizing; she was almost like a
      comrade, Kurt thought afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, he was surprised to have her appear equipped for the
      street, although it was bitterly cold. She wore her garb of ceremony, a
      black alpaca gown, with a white crocheted collar neatly turned over the
      long black, broadcloth cloak in which she had taken pride for the last
      five years; and her quilted black silk bonnet was on her gray head. When
      she put up her foot to don her warm overshoes Kurt saw that the stout
      ankles were encased in white stockings. This was the last touch.
      &ldquo;Gracious, Thekla,&rdquo; cried Kurt, &ldquo;are you going to market this day? It is
      the coldest day this winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind,&rdquo; replied Thekla, nervously. Then she had wrapped a
      scarf about her and gone out while he was getting into his own coat, and
      conning a proffer to go in her stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, Thekla she aint such a fool like she looks!&rdquo; he observed to the
      cat, &ldquo;say, pussy, WAS it you out yestiddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cat only blinked her yellow eyes and purred. She knew that she had not
      been out, last night. Not any better than her mistress, however, who at
      this moment was hailing a street-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street-car did not land her anywhere near a market; it whirled her
      past the lines of low wooden houses into the big brick shops with their
      arched windows and terra-cotta ornaments that showed the ambitious
      architecture of a growing Western town, past these into mills and
      factories and smoke-stained chimneys. Here, she stopped. An acquaintance
      would hardly have recognized her, her ruddy cheeks had grown so pale. But
      she trotted on to the great building on the corner from whence came a low,
      incessant buzz. She went into the first door and ran against Carl Olsen.
      &ldquo;Carl, I got to see Mr. Lossing,&rdquo; said she breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't noding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Gott sei dank', but I got to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not Carl's way to ask questions; he promptly showed her the office
      and she entered. She had not seen young Harry Lossing half a dozen times;
      and, now, her anxious eyes wandered from one dapper figure at the high
      desks, to another, until Lossing advanced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a handsome young man, she thought, and he had kind eyes, but they
      hardened at her first timid sentence: &ldquo;I am Mrs. Lieders, I come about my
      man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you walk in here, Mrs. Lieders?&rdquo; said Lossing. His voice was like
      the ice on the window-panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him into a little room. He shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Declining the chair that he pushed toward her she stood in the centre of
      the room, looking at him with the pleading eyes of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lossing, will you please save my Kurt from killing himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Lossing's voice had not thawed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you that he will kill himself, Mr. Lossing. This is the dird
      time he has done it. It is because he is so lonesome now, your father is
      died and he thinks that you forget, and he has worked so hard for you, but
      he thinks that you forget. He was never tell me till yesterday; and then&mdash;it
      was&mdash;it was because I would not let him hang himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang himself?&rdquo; stammered Lossing, &ldquo;you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was hang himself, but I cut him, no I broke him down,&rdquo; said
      Thekla, accurate in all the disorder of her spirits; and forthwith, with
      many tremors, but clearly, she told the story of Kurt's despair. She told,
      as Lieders never would have known how to tell, even had his pride let him,
      all the man's devotion for the business, all his personal attachment to
      the firm; she told of his gloom after the elder Lossing died, &ldquo;for he was
      think there was no one in this town such good man and so smart like your
      fader, Mr. Lossing, no, and he would set all the evening and try to draw
      and make the lines all wrong, and, then, he would drow the papers in the
      fire and go and walk outside and he say, 'I can't do nothing righd no more
      now the old man's died; they don't have no use for me at the shop, pretty
      quick!' and that make him feel awful bad!&rdquo; She told of his homesick
      wanderings about the shops by night; &ldquo;but he was better as a watchman, he
      wouldn't hurt it for the world! He telled me how you was hide his
      dinner-pail onct for a joke, and put in a piece of your pie, and how you
      climbed on the roof with the hose when it was afire. And he telled me if
      he shall die I shall tell you that he ain't got no hard feelings, but you
      didn't know how that mantel had ought to be, so he done it right the other
      way, but he hadn't no righd to talk to you like he done, nohow, and you
      was all righd to send him away, but you might a shaked hands, and none of
      the boys never said nothing nor none of them never come to see him, 'cept
      Carl Olsen, and that make him feel awful bad, too! And when he feels so
      bad he don't no more want to live, so I make him promise if I git him back
      he never try to kill himself again. Oh, Mr. Lossing, please don't let my
      man die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered and more touched than he cared to feel, himself, Lossing still
      made a feeble stand for discipline. &ldquo;I don't see how Lieders can expect me
      to take him back again,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He aint expecting you, Mr. Lossing, it's ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn't Lieders tell you I told him I would never take him back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no, Mr. Lossing, it was not that, it was you said it would be a
      cold day that you would take him back; and it was git so cold yesterday,
      so I think, 'Now it would be a cold day to-morrow and Mr. Lossing he can
      take Kurt back.' And it IS the most coldest day this year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lossing burst into a laugh, perhaps he was glad to have the Western sense
      of humor come to the rescue of his compassion. &ldquo;Well, it was a cold day
      for you to come all this way for nothing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You go home and tell
      Lieders to report to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kurt's manner of receiving the news was characteristic. He snorted in
      disgust: &ldquo;Well, I did think he had more sand than to give in to a woman!&rdquo;
       But after he heard the whole story he chuckled: &ldquo;Yes, it was that way he
      said, and he must do like he said; but that was a funny way you done,
      Thekla. Say, mamma, yesterday, was you look out for the cat or to find how
      cold it been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, papa,&rdquo; said Thekla, &ldquo;you remember what you promised if I
      git you back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieders's eyes grew dull; he flung his arms out, with a long sigh. &ldquo;No, I
      don't forget, I will keep my promise, but&mdash;it is like the handcuffs,
      Thekla, it is like the handcuffs!&rdquo; In a second, however, he added, in a
      changed tone, &ldquo;But thou art a kind jailer, mamma, more like a comrade. And
      no, it was not fair to thee&mdash;I know that now, Thekla.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE FACE OF FAILURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      AFTER the week's shower the low Iowa hills looked vividly green. At the
      base of the first range of hills the Blackhawk road winds from the city to
      the prairie. From its starting-point, just outside the city limits, the
      wayfarer may catch bird's-eye glimpses of the city, the vast river that
      the Iowans love, and the three bridges tying three towns to the island
      arsenal. But at one's elbow spreads Cavendish's melon farm. Cavendish's
      melon farm it still is, in current phrase, although Cavendish, whose
      memory is honored by lovers of the cantaloupe melon, long ago departed to
      raise melons for larger markets; and still a weather-beaten sign creaks
      from a post announcing to the world that &ldquo;the celebrated Cavendish Melons
      are for Sale here!&rdquo; To-day the melon-vines were softly shaded by
      rain-drops. A pleasant sight they made, spreading for acres in front of
      the green-houses where mushrooms and early vegetables strove to outwit the
      seasons, and before the brown cottage in which Cavendish had begun a
      successful career. The black roof-tree of the cottage sagged in the
      middle, and the weather-boarding was dingy with the streaky dinginess of
      old paint that has never had enough oil. The fences, too, were unpainted
      and rudely patched. Nevertheless a second glance told one that there were
      no gaps in them, that the farm machines kept their bright colors well
      under cover, and that the garden rows were beautifully straight and clean.
      An old white horse switched its sleek sides with its long tail and drooped
      its untrammelled neck in front of the gate. The wagon to which it was
      harnessed was new and had just been washed. Near the gate stood a girl and
      boy who seemed to be mutually studying each other's person. Decidedly the
      girl's slim, light figure in its dainty frock repaid one's eyes for their
      trouble; and her face, with its brilliant violet eyes, its full, soft
      chin, its curling auburn hair and delicate tints, was charming; but her
      brother's look was anything but approving. His lip curled and his small
      gray eyes grew smaller under his scowling brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is THAT your best suit?&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is; and it's GOING to be for one while,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a suit of the cotton mixture that looks like wool when it is new,
      and cuts a figure on the counters of every dealer in cheap ready-made
      clothing. It had been Tim Powell's best attire for a year; perhaps he had
      not been careful enough of it, and that was why it no longer cared even to
      imitate wool; it was faded to the hue of a clay bank, it was threadbare,
      the trousers bagged at the knees, the jacket bagged at the elbows, the
      pockets bulged flabbily from sheer force of habit, although there was
      nothing in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were to have a new suit,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Uncle told me
      himself he was going to buy you one yesterday when you went to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have asked him to buy me anything yesterday for more'n a suit
      of clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The girl opened her eyes. &ldquo;Didn't he do anything with the lawyer?
      Is that why you are both so glum this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't. The lawyer says the woman that owns the mortgage has got
      to have the money. And it's due next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl grew pale all over her pretty rosy cheeks; her eyes filled with
      tears as she gasped, &ldquo;Oh, how hateful of her, when she promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never promised nothing, Eve; it ain't been hers for more than three
      months. Sloan, that used to have it, died, and left his property to be
      divided up between his nieces; and the mortgage is her share. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care, it's just as mean. Mr. Sloan promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't; he jest said if Uncle was behind he wouldn't press him;
      and he did let Uncle get behind with the interest two times and never
      kicked. But he died; and now the woman, she wants her money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is mean and cruel of her to turn us out! Uncle says mortgages
      are wicked anyhow, and I believe him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he couldn't have bought this place if he didn't give a mortgage
      on it. And he'd have had enough to pay cash, too, if Richards hadn't
      begged him so to lend it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is Richards going to pay him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It come due three months ago; Richards ain't never paid up the interest
      even, and now he says he's got to have the mortgage extended for three
      years; anyhow for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't he KNOW we've got to pay our own mortgage? How can we help HIM?
      I wish Uncle would sell him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy gave her the superior smile of the masculine creature. &ldquo;I
      suppose,&rdquo; he remarked with elaborate irony, &ldquo;that he's like Uncle and you;
      he thinks mortgages are wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just as like as not Uncle won't want to go to the carnival,&rdquo; Eve went
      on, her eyes filling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim gazed at her, scowling and sneering; but she was absorbed in dreams
      and hopes with which as yet his boyish mind had no point of contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the girls in the A class were going to go to see the fireworks
      together, and George Dean and some of the boys were going to take us, and
      we were going to have tea at May Arlington's house, and I was to stay all
      night;&rdquo;&mdash;this came in a half sob. &ldquo;I think it is just too mean! I
      never have any good times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do, sis, lots! Uncle always gits you everything you want.
      And he feels terrible bad when I&mdash;when he knows he can't afford to
      git something you want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know well enough who tells him we can't afford things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you want us to git things we can't afford? I ain't never advised
      him except the best I knew how. I told him Richards was a blow-hard, and I
      told him those Alliance grocery folks he bought such a lot of truck of
      would skin him, and they did; those canned things they sold him was all
      musty, and they said there wasn't any freight on 'em, and he had to pay
      freight and a fancy price besides; and I don't believe they had any more
      to do with the Alliance than our cow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle always believes everything. He always is so sure things are going
      to turn out just splendid; and they don't&mdash;only just middling; and
      then he loses a lot of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is an awful good man,&rdquo; said the boy, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe in being so good you can't make money. I don't want
      always to be poor and despised, and have the other girls have prettier
      clothes than me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you can be pretty good and yet make money, if you are sharp
      enough. Of course you got to be sharper to be good and make money than you
      got to be, to be mean and make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know one thing, that Uncle ain't EVER going to make money. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       The last word shrivelled on her lips, which puckered into a confused smile
      at the warning frown of her brother. The man that they were discussing had
      come round to them past the henhouse. How much had he overheard?
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't seem angry, anyhow. He called: &ldquo;Well, Evy, ready?&rdquo; and Eve was
      glad to run into the house for her hat without looking at him. It was a
      relief that she must sit on the back seat where she need not face Uncle
      Nelson. Tim sat in front; but Tim was so stupid he wouldn't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he; it was Nelson Forrest that stole furtive glances at the lad's
      profile, the knitted brows, the freckled cheeks, the undecided nose, and
      firm mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boyish shoulders slouched forward at the same angle as that of the
      fifty-year-old shoulders beside him. Nelson, through long following of the
      plough, had lost the erect carriage painfully acquired in the army. He was
      a handsome man, whose fresh-colored skin gave him a perpetual appearance
      of having just washed his face. The features were long and delicate. The
      brown eyes had a liquid softness like the eyes of a woman. In general the
      countenance was alertly intelligent; he looked younger than his years; but
      this afternoon the lines about his mouth and in his brows warranted every
      gray hair of his pointed short beard. There was a reason. Nelson was
      having one of those searing flashes of insight that do come occasionally
      to the most blindly hopeful souls. Nelson had hoped all his life. He hoped
      for himself, he hoped for the whole human race. He served the abstraction
      that he called &ldquo;PROgress&rdquo; with unflinching and unquestioning loyalty.
      Every new scheme of increasing happiness by force found a helper, a
      fighter, and a giver in him; by turns he had been an Abolitionist, a
      Fourierist, a Socialist, a Greenbacker, a Farmers' Alliance man.
      Disappointment always was followed hard on its heels by a brand-new
      confidence. Progress ruled his farm as well as his politics; he bought the
      newest implements and subscribed trustfully to four agricultural papers;
      but being a born lover of the ground, a vein of saving doubt did assert
      itself sometimes in his work; and, on the whole, as a farmer he was
      successful. But his success never ventured outside his farm gates. At
      buying or selling, at a bargain in any form, the fourteen-year-old Tim was
      better than Nelson with his fifty years' experience of a wicked and
      bargaining world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that any part of the reason, he wondered to-day, why at the end of
      thirty years of unflinching toil and honesty, he found himself with a vast
      budget of experience in the ruinous loaning of money, with a mortgage on
      the farm of a friend, and a mortgage on his own farm likely to be
      foreclosed? Perhaps it might have been better to stay in Henry County. He
      had paid for his farm at last. He had known a good moment, too, that day
      he drove away from the lawyer's with the cancelled mortgage in his pocket
      and Tim hopping up and down on the seat for joy. But the next day Richards&mdash;just
      to give him the chance of a good thing&mdash;had brought out that Maine
      man who wanted to buy him out. He was anxious to put the money down for
      the new farm, to have no whip-lash of debt forever whistling about his
      ears as he ploughed, ready to sting did he stumble in the furrows; and Tim
      was more anxious than he; but&mdash;there was Richards! Richards was a
      neighbor who thought as he did about Henry George and Spiritualism, and
      belonged to the Farmers' Alliance, and had lent Nelson all the works of
      Henry George that he (Richards) could borrow. Richards was in deep
      trouble. He had lost his wife; he might lose his farm. He appealed to
      Nelson, for the sake of old friendship, to save him. And Nelson could not
      resist; so, two thousand of the thirty-four hundred dollars that the Maine
      man paid went to Richards, the latter swearing by all that is holy, to pay
      his friend off in full at the end of the year. There was money coming to
      him from his dead wife's estate, but it was tied up in the courts. Nelson
      would not listen to Tim's prophecies of evil. But he was a little dashed
      when Richards paid neither interest nor principal at the year's end,
      although he gave reasons of weight; and he experienced veritable
      consternation when the renewed mortgage ran its course and still Richards
      could not pay. The money from his wife's estate had been used to improve
      his farm (Nelson knew how rundown everything was), his new wife was sickly
      and &ldquo;didn't seem to take hold,&rdquo; there had been a disastrous hail-storm&mdash;but
      why rehearse the calamities? they focussed on one sentence: it was
      impossible to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nelson, who had been restfully counting on the money from Richards
      for his own debt, bestirred himself, only to find his patient creditor
      gone and a woman in his stead who must have her money. He wrote again&mdash;sorely
      against his will&mdash;begging Richards to raise the money somehow.
      Richards's answer was in his pocket, for he wore the best black broadcloth
      in which he had done honor to the lawyer, yesterday. Richards plainly was
      wounded; but he explained in detail to Nelson how he (Nelson) could borrow
      money of the banks on his farm and pay Miss Brown. There was no bank where
      Richards could borrow money; and he begged Nelson not to drive his wife
      and little children from their cherished home. Nelson choked over the
      pathos when he read the letter to Tim; but Tim only grunted a wish that HE
      had the handling of that feller. And the lawyer was as little moved as
      Tim. Miss Brown needed the money, he said. The banks were not disposed to
      lend just at present; money, it appeared, was &ldquo;tight;&rdquo; so, in the end,
      Nelson drove home with the face of Failure staring at him between his
      horses' ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one way. Should he make Richards suffer or suffer himself?
      Did a man have to grind other people or be ground himself? Meanwhile they
      had reached the town. The stir of a festival was in the air. On every side
      bunting streamed in the breeze or was draped across brick or wood. Arches
      spanned some of the streets, with inscriptions of welcome on them, and
      swarms of colored lanterns glittered against the sunlight almost as gayly
      as they would show when they should be lighted at night. Little children
      ran about waving flags. Grocery wagons and butchers' wagons trotted by
      with a flash of flags dangling from the horses' harness. The streets were
      filled with people in their holiday clothes. Everybody smiled. The
      shopkeepers answered questions and went out on the sidewalks to direct
      strangers. From one window hung a banner inviting visitors to enter and
      get a list of hotels and boarding-houses. The crowd was entirely
      good-humored and waited outside restaurants, bandying jokes with true
      Western philosophy. At times the wagons made a temporary blockade in the
      street, but no one grumbled. Bands of music paraded past them, the escort
      for visitors of especial consideration. In a window belonging, the sign
      above declared, to the Business Men's Association, stood a huge doll clad
      in blue satin, on which was painted a device of Neptune sailing down the
      Mississippi amid a storm of fireworks. The doll stood in a boat arched
      about with lantern-decked hoops, and while Nelson halted, unable to
      proceed, he could hear the voluble explanation of the proud citizen who
      was interpreting to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, Nelson thought, was success. Here were the successful men. The man
      who had failed looked at them. Eve roused him by a shrill cry, &ldquo;There they
      are. There's May and the girls. Let me out quick, Uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped the horse and jumped out himself to help her. It was the first
      time since she came under his roof that she had been away from it all
      night. He cleared his throat for some advice on behavior. &ldquo;Mind and be
      respectful to Mrs. Arlington. Say yes, ma'am, and no, ma'am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He got no further, for Eve gave him a hasty kiss and the crowd brushed her
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All she thinks of is wearing fine clothes and going with the fellers!&rdquo;
       said her brother, disdainfully. &ldquo;If I had to be born a girl, I wouldn't be
      born at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe if you despise girls so, you'll be born a girl the next time,&rdquo; said
      Nelson. &ldquo;Some folks thinks that's how it happens with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do YOU, Uncle?&rdquo; asked Tim, running his mind forebodingly over the
      possible business results of such a belief. &ldquo;S'posing he shouldn't be
      willing to sell the pigs to be killed, 'cause they might be some friends
      of his!&rdquo; he reflected, with a rising tide of consternation. Nelson smiled
      rather sadly. He said, in another tone: &ldquo;Tim, I've thought so many things,
      that now I've about given up thinking. All I can do is to live along the
      best way I know how and help the world move the best I'm able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet <i>I</i> ain't going to help the world move,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;I'm
      going to look out for myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my training of you has turned out pretty badly, if that's the way
      you feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little shiver passed over the lad's sullen face; he flushed until he
      lost his freckles in the red veil and burst out passionately: &ldquo;Well, I got
      eyes, ain't I? I ain't going to be bad, or drink, or steal, or do things
      to git put in the penitentiary; but I ain't going to let folks walk all
      over me like you do; no, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson did not answer; in his heart he thought that he had failed with the
      children, too; and he relapsed into that dismal study of the face of
      Failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to the city to show Tim the sights, and, therefore, though
      like a man in a dream, he drove conscientiously about the gay streets,
      pointing out whatever he thought might interest the boy, and generally
      discovering that Tim had the new information by heart already. All the
      while a question pounded itself, like the beat of the heart of an engine,
      through the noise and the talk: &ldquo;Shall I give up Richards or be turned out
      myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the afternoon sunlight waned he put up the horse at a modest little
      stable where farmers were allowed to bring their own provender. The
      charges were of the smallest and the place neat and weather-tight, but it
      had been a long time before Nelson could be induced to use it, because
      there was a higher-priced stable kept by an ex-farmer and member of the
      Farmers' Alliance. Only the fact that the keeper of the low-priced stable
      was a poor orphan girl, struggling to earn an honest livelihood, had moved
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had supper at a restaurant of Tim's discovery, small, specklessly
      tidy, and as unexacting of the pocket as the stable. It was an excellent
      supper. But Nelson had no appetite; in spite of an almost childish
      capacity for being diverted, he could attend to nothing but the question
      always in his ears: &ldquo;Richards or me&mdash;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until it should be time for the spectacle they walked down the hill, and
      watched the crowds gradually blacken every inch of the river-banks.
      Already the swarms of lanterns were beginning to bloom out in the dusk.
      Strains of music throbbed through the air, adding a poignant touch to the
      excitement vibrating in all the faces and voices about them. Even the
      stolid Tim felt the contagion. He walked with a jaunty step and assaulted
      a tune himself. &ldquo;I tell you, Uncle,&rdquo; says Tim, &ldquo;it's nice of these folks
      to be getting up all this show, and giving it for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; says Nelson. &ldquo;You don't love your book as I wish you
      did; but I guess you remember about the ancient Romans, and how the great,
      rich Romans used to spend enormous sums in games and shows that they let
      the people in free to&mdash;well, what for? Was it to learn them anything
      or to make them happy? Oh, no, it was to keep down the spirit of liberty,
      Son, it was to make them content to be slaves! And so it is here. These
      merchants and capitalists are only looking out for themselves, trying to
      keep labor down and not let it know how oppressed it is, trying to get
      people here from everywhere to show what a fine city they have and get
      their money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'TIS a fine town,&rdquo; Tim burst in, &ldquo;a boss town! And they ain't
      gouging folks a little bit. None of the hotels or the restaurants have put
      up their prices one cent. Look what a dandy supper we got for twenty-five
      cents! And ain't the boy at Lumley's grocery given me two tickets to set
      on the steamboat? There's nothing mean about this town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson made no remark; but he thought, for the fiftieth time, that his
      farm was too near the city. Tim was picking up all the city boys' false
      pride as well as their slang. Unconscious Tim resumed his tune. He knew
      that it was &ldquo;Annie Rooney&rdquo; if no one else did, and he mangled the notes
      with appropriate exhilaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the river was as busy as the land, lights swimming hither and
      thither; steamboats with ropes of tiny stars bespangling their dark bulk
      and a white electric glare in the bow, low boats with lights that sent
      wavering spear-heads into the shadow beneath. The bridge was a blazing
      barbed fence of fire, and beyond the bridge, at the point of the island,
      lay a glittering multitude of lights, a fairy fleet with miniature sails
      outlined in flame as if by jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelson followed Tim. The crowds, the ceaseless clatter of tongues and jar
      of wheels, depressed the man, who hardly knew which way to dodge the
      multitudinous perils of the thoroughfare; but Tim used his elbows to such
      good purpose that they were out of the levee, on the steamboat, and
      settling themselves in two comfortable chairs in a coign of vantage on
      deck, that commanded the best obtainable view of the pageant, before
      Nelson had gathered his wits together enough to plan a path out of the
      crush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sized up this place from the shore,&rdquo; Tim sighed complacently, drawing a
      long breath of relief; &ldquo;only jest two chairs, so we won't be crowded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently, Nelson took his chair. His head sank on his thin chest.
      Richards or himself, which should he sacrifice? So the weary old question
      droned through his brain. He felt a tap on his shoulder. The man who
      roused him was an acquaintance, and he stood smiling in the attitude of a
      man about to ask a favor, while the expectant half-smile of the lady on
      his arm hinted at the nature of the favor. Would Mr. Forrest be so kind?&mdash;there
      seemed to be no more seats. Before Mr. Forrest could be kind Tim had
      yielded his own chair and was off, wriggling among the crowd in search of
      another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart boy, that youngster of yours,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;he'll make his way in
      the world, he can push. Well, Miss Alma, let me make you acquainted with
      Mr. Forrest. I know you will be well entertained by him. So, if you'll
      excuse me, I'll get back and help my wife wrestle with the kids. They have
      been trying to see which will fall overboard first ever since we came on
      deck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the leeway of this pleasantry he bowed and retired. Nelson turned
      with determined politeness to the lady. He was sorry that she had come,
      she looking to him a very fine lady indeed, with her black silk gown, her
      shining black ornaments, and her bright black eyes. She was not young, but
      handsome in Nelson's judgment, although of a haughty bearing. &ldquo;Maybe she
      is the principal of the High School,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Martin has her for a
      boarder, and he said she was very particular about her melons being cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But however formidable a personage, the lady must be entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you are a resident of the city, ma'am?&rdquo; said Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was born here.&rdquo; She smiled, a smile that revealed a little break
      in the curve of her cheek, not exactly a dimple, but like one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know when I have seen such a fine appearing lady,&rdquo; thought
      Nelson. He responded: &ldquo;Well, I wasn't born here; but I come when I was a
      little shaver of ten and stayed till I was eighteen, when I went to Kansas
      to help fight the border ruffians. I went to school here in the Warren
      Street school-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I, as long as I went anywhere to school. I had to go to work when
      I was twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson's amazement took shape before his courtesy had a chance to control
      it. &ldquo;I didn't suppose you ever did any work in your life!&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I haven't done much else. Father died when I was twelve and the
      oldest of five, the next only eight&mdash;Polly, that came between Eb and
      me, died&mdash;naturally I had to work. I was a nurse-girl by the day,
      first; and I never shall forget how kind the woman was to me. She gave me
      so much dinner I never needed to eat any breakfast, which was a help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor little thing! I'm afraid you went hungry sometimes.&rdquo; Immediately
      he marvelled at his familiar speech, but she did not seem to resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so often,&rdquo; she said, musingly; &ldquo;but I used often and often to
      wish I could carry some of the nice things home to mother and the babies.
      After a while she would give me a cookey or a piece of bread and butter
      for lunch; that I could take home. I don't suppose I'll often have more
      pleasure than I used to have then, seeing little Eb waiting for sister;
      and the baby and mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly, to continue,
      in an instant, with a kind of laugh; &ldquo;I am never likely to feel so
      important again as I did then, either. It was great to have mother
      consulting me, as if I had been grown up. I felt like I had the weight of
      the nation on my shoulders, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you always worked since? You are not working out now?&rdquo; with a
      glance at her shining gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not for a long time. I learned to be a cook. I was a good cook,
      too, if I say it myself. I worked for the Lossings for four years. I am
      not a bit ashamed of being a hired girl, for I was as good a one as I knew
      how. It was Mrs. Lossing that first lent me books; and Harry Lossing, who
      is head of the firm now, got Ebenezer into the works. Ebenezer is
      shipping-clerk with a good salary and stock in the concern; and Ralph is
      there, learning the trade. I went to the business-college and learned
      book-keeping, and afterward I learned typewriting and shorthand. I have
      been working for the firm for fourteen years. We have educated the girls.
      Milly is married, and Kitty goes to the boarding-school, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you haven't been married yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time did I have to think of being married? I had the family on my
      mind, and looking after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was more fortunate for your family than it was for my sex,&rdquo; said
      Nelson, gallantly. He accompanied the compliment by a glance of
      admiration, extinguished in an eye-flash, for the white radiance that had
      bathed the deck suddenly vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will see a lovely sight,&rdquo; said the woman, deigning no reply to
      his tribute; &ldquo;listen! That is the signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air was shaken with the boom of cannon. Once, twice, thrice. Directly
      the boat-whistles took up the roar, making a hideous din. The fleet had
      moved. Spouting rockets and Roman candles, which painted above it a
      kaleidoscopic archway of fire, welcomed by answering javelins of light and
      red and orange and blue and green flares from the shore; the fleet
      bombarded the bridge, escorted Neptune in his car, manoeuvred and massed
      and charged on the blazing city with a many-hued shower of flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the boats, silently, softly, floated the battalions of lanterns, so
      close to the water that they seemed flaming water-lilies, while the dusky
      mirror repeated and inverted their splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're shingles, you know,&rdquo; explained Nelson's companion, &ldquo;with lanterns
      on them; but aren't they pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are! I wish you had not told me. It is like a fairy story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it? But we aren't through; there's more to come. Beautiful
      fireworks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fireworks, however, were slow of coming. They could see the barge from
      which they were to be sent; they could watch the movements of the men in
      white oil-cloth who moved in a ghostly fashion about the barge; they could
      hear the tap of hammers; but nothing came of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in the darkness, waiting; and there came to Nelson a strange
      sensation of being alone and apart from all the breathing world with this
      woman. He did not perceive that Tim had quietly returned with a box which
      did very well for a seat, and was sitting with his knees against the
      chair-rungs. He seemed to be somehow outside of all the tumult and the
      spectacle. It was the vainglorying triumph of this world. He was the soul
      outside, the soul that had missed its triumph. In his perplexity and
      loneliness he felt an overwhelming longing for sympathy; neither did it
      strike Nelson, who believed in all sorts of occult influences, that his
      confidence in a stranger was unwarranted. He would have told you that his
      &ldquo;psychic instincts&rdquo; never played him false, although really they were
      traitors from their astral cradles to their astral graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said in a hesitating way: &ldquo;You must excuse me being kinder dull; I've
      got some serious business on my mind and I can't help thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? Well, I know how that is; I have often stayed awake nights
      worrying about things. Lest I shouldn't suit and all that&mdash;especially
      after mother took sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose you had to give up and nurse her then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what Ebenezer and Ralph were for having me do; but mother&mdash;my
      mother always had so much sense&mdash;mother says, 'No, Alma, you've got a
      good place and a chance in life, you sha'n't give it up. We'll hire a
      girl. I ain't never lonesome except evenings, and then you will be home. I
      should jest want to die,' she says, 'if I thought I kept you in a kind of
      prison like by my being sick&mdash;now, just when you are getting on so
      well.' There never WAS a woman like my mother!&rdquo; Her voice shook a little,
      and Nelson asked gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't your mother living now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she died last year.&rdquo; She added, after a little silence, &ldquo;I somehow
      can't get used to being lonesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS hard,&rdquo; said Nelson. &ldquo;I lost my wife three years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's hard, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness! I guess it is. And it's hardest when trouble comes on a man
      and he can't go nowhere for advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so, too. But&mdash;have you any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am; that is, they ain't my own children. Lizzie and I never had
      any; but these two we took and they are most like my own. The girl is
      eighteen and the boy rising of fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be a comfort to you; but they are considerable of a
      responsibility, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; he sighed softly to himself. &ldquo;Sometimes I feel I haven't
      done the right way by them, though I've tried. Not that they ain't good
      children, for they are&mdash;no better anywhere. Tim, he will work from
      morning till night, and never need to urge him; and he never gives me a
      promise he don't keep it, no ma'am, never did since he was a little mite
      of a lad. And he is a kind boy, too, always good to the beasts; and while
      he may speak up a little short to his sister, he saves her many a step. He
      doesn't take to his studies quite as I would like to have him, but he has
      a wonderful head for business. There is splendid stuff in Tim if it could
      only be worked right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Nelson spoke, Tim was hunching his shoulders forward in the
      darkness, listening with the whole of two sharp ears. His face worked in
      spite of him, and he gave an inarticulate snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;I think that speaks well for Tim. Why should you
      be worried about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he is getting to love money and worldly success too well, and
      that is what I fear for the girl, too. You see, she is so pretty, and the
      idols of the tribe and the market, as Bacon calls them, are strong with
      the young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so,&rdquo; the woman assented vaguely, not at all sure what either
      Bacon or his idols might be. &ldquo;Are the children relations of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; it was like this: When I was up in Henry County there came a
      photographic artist to the village near us, and pitched his tent and took
      tintypes in his wagon. He had his wife and his two children with him. The
      poor woman fell ill and died; so we took the two children. My wife was
      willing; she was a wonderfully good woman, member of the Methodist church
      till she died. I&mdash;I am not a church member myself, ma'am; I passed
      through that stage of spiritual development a long while ago.&rdquo; He gave a
      wistful glance at his companion's dimly outlined profile. &ldquo;But I never
      tried to disturb her faith; it made HER happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think it is any good fooling with other people's religions,&rdquo;
       said the woman, easily. &ldquo;It is just like trying to talk folks out of
      drinking; nobody knows what is right for anybody else's soul any more than
      they do what is good for anybody else's stomach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. You put things very clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it is because you understand so quickly. But you were saying&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all the story. We took the children, and their father was killed
      by the cars the next year, poor man; and so we have done the best we could
      ever since by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say you had done very well by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; I haven't done very well somehow by anyone, myself included,
      though God knows I've tried hard enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the silence natural after such a confession when the
      listener does not know the speaker well enough to parry abasement by
      denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am impressed,&rdquo; said Nelson, simply, &ldquo;to talk with you frankly. It isn't
      polite to bother strangers with your troubles, but I am impressed that you
      won't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I won't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not extravagant sympathy; but Nelson thought how kind her voice
      sounded, and what a musical voice it was. Most people would have called it
      rather sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her&mdash;with surprisingly little egotism, as the keen listener
      noted&mdash;the story of his life; the struggle of his boyhood; his random
      self-education; his years in the army (he had criticised his superior
      officers, thereby losing the promotion that was coming for bravery in the
      field); his marriage (apparently he had married his wife because another
      man had jilted her); his wrestle with nature (whose pranks included a
      cyclone) on a frontier farm that he eventually lost, having put all his
      savings into a &ldquo;Greenback&rdquo; newspaper, and being thus swamped with debt;
      his final slow success in paying for his Iowa farm; and his purchase of
      the new farm, with its resulting disaster. &ldquo;I've farmed in Kansas,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;in Nebraska, in Dakota, in Iowa. I was willing to go wherever the
      land promised. It always seemed like I was going to succeed, but somehow I
      never did. The world ain't fixed right for the workers, I take it. A man
      who has spent thirty years in hard, honest toil oughtn't to be staring
      ruin in the face like I am to-day. They won't let it be so when we have
      the single tax and when we farmers send our own men instead of city
      lawyers, to the Legislature and halls of Congress. Sometimes I think it's
      the world that's wrong and sometimes I think it's me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply came in crisp and assured accents, which were the strongest
      contrast to Nelson's soft, undecided pipe: &ldquo;Seems to me in this last case
      the one most to blame is neither you nor the world at large, but this man
      Richards, who is asking YOU to pay for HIS farm. And I notice you don't
      seem to consider your creditor in this business. How do you know she don't
      need the money? Look at me, for instance; I'm in some financial difficulty
      myself. I have a mortgage for two thousand dollars, and that mortgage&mdash;for
      which good value was given, mind you&mdash;falls due this month. I want
      the money. I want it bad. I have a chance to put my money into stock at
      the factory. I know all about the investment; I haven't worked there all
      these years and not know how the business stands. It is a chance to make a
      fortune. I ain't likely to ever have another like it; and it won't wait
      for me to make up my mind forever, either. Isn't it hard on me, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord knows it is, ma'am,&rdquo; said Nelson, despondently; &ldquo;it is hard on us
      all! Sometimes I don't see the end of it all. A vast social revolution&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Social fiddlesticks! I beg your pardon, Mr. Forrest, but it puts me out
      of patience to have people expecting to be allowed to make every mortal
      kind of fools of themselves and then have 'a social revolution' jump in to
      slue off the consequences. Let us understand each other. Who do you
      suppose I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss&mdash;Miss Almer, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Alma Brown, Mr. Forrest. I saw you coming on the boat and I made Mr.
      Martin fetch me over to you. I told him not to say my name, because I
      wanted a good plain talk with you. Well, I've had it. Things are just
      about where I thought they were, and I told Mr. Lossing so. But I couldn't
      be sure. You must have thought me a funny kind of woman to be telling you
      all those things about myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson, who had changed color half a dozen times in the darkness, sighed
      before he said: &ldquo;No, ma'am; I only thought how good you were to tell me. I
      hoped maybe you were impressed to trust me as I was to trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being so dark Nelson could not see the queer expression on her face as she
      slowly shook her head. She was thinking: &ldquo;If I ever saw a babe in arms
      trying to do business! How did HE ever pay for a farm?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Well, I
      did it on purpose; I wanted you to know I wasn't a cruel aristocrat, but a
      woman that had worked as hard as yourself. Now, why shouldn't you help me
      and yourself instead of helping Richards? You have confidence in me, you
      say. Well, show it. I'll give you your mortgage for your mortgage on
      Richards's farm. Come, can't you trust Richards to me? You think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hiss of a rocket hurled her words into space. The fireworks had begun.
      Miss Brown looked at them and watched Nelson at the same time. As a good
      business woman who was also a good citizen, having subscribed five dollars
      to the carnival, she did not propose to lose the worth of her money;
      neither did she intend to lose a chance to do business. Perhaps there was
      an obscurer and more complex motive lurking in some stray corner of that
      queer garret, a woman's mind. Such motives&mdash;aimless softenings of the
      heart, unprofitable diversions of the fancy&mdash;will seep unconsciously
      through the toughest business principles of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was puzzled by the look of exaltation on Nelson's features, illumined
      as they were by the uncanny light. If the fool man had not forgotten all
      his troubles just to see a few fireworks! No, he was not that kind of a
      fool; maybe&mdash;and she almost laughed aloud in her pleasure over her
      own insight&mdash;maybe it all made him think of the war, where he had
      been so brave. &ldquo;He was a regular hero in the war,&rdquo; Miss Brown concluded,
      &ldquo;and he certainly is a perfect gentleman; what a pity he hasn't got any
      sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had guessed aright, although she had not guessed deep enough in regard
      to Nelson. He watched the great wheels of light, he watched the river
      aflame with Greek fire, then, with a shiver, he watched the bombs bursting
      into myriads of flowers, into fizzing snakes, into fields of burning gold,
      into showers of jewels that made the night splendid for a second and
      faded. They were not fireworks to him; they were a magical phantasmagoria
      that renewed the incoherent and violent emotions of his youth; again he
      was in the chaos of the battle, or he was dreaming by his camp-fire, or he
      was pacing his lonely round on guard. His heart leaped again with the old
      glow, the wonderful, beautiful worship of Liberty that can do no wrong. He
      seemed to hear a thousand voices chanting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, As He died to
      make men holy, let us die to make men free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His turbid musings cleared&mdash;or they seemed to him to clear&mdash;under
      the strong reaction of his imagination and his memories. It was all over,
      the dream and the glory thereof. The splendid young soldier was an
      elderly, ruined man. But one thing was left: he could be true to his flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor soldier, but enlisted for the war,&rdquo; says Nelson, squaring his
      shoulders, with a lump in his throat and his eyes brimming. &ldquo;I know by the
      way it hurts me to think of refusing her that it's a temptation to
      wrong-doing. No, I can't save myself by sacrificing a brother soldier for
      humanity. She is just as kind as she can be, but women don't understand
      business; she wouldn't make allowance for Richards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt a hand on his shoulder; it was Martin apologizing for hurrying
      Miss Brown; but the baby was fretting and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry&mdash;yes&mdash;well, I wish you didn't have to go!&rdquo; Nelson
      began; but a hoarse treble rose from under his elbows: &ldquo;Say, Mr. Martin,
      Uncle and me can take Miss Brown home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will allow me the pleasure,&rdquo; said Nelson, with the touch of
      courtliness that showed through his homespun ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I WOULD like to see the hundred bombs bursting at once and Vulcan
      at his forge!&rdquo; said Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the matter arranged itself. Tim waited with the lady while Nelson
      went for the horse, nor was it until afterward that Miss Brown wondered
      why the lad did not go instead of the man. But Tim had his own reasons. No
      sooner was Nelson out of earshot than he began: &ldquo;Say, Miss Brown, I can
      tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Richards is no good; but you can't get Uncle to see it. At least it
      will take time. If you'll help me we can get him round in time. Won't you
      please not sell us out for six months and give me a show? I'll see you get
      your interest and your money, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; Miss Brown involuntarily took a business attitude, with her arms
      akimbo, and eyed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, me. I ain't so very old, but I know all about the business. I
      got all the figures down&mdash;how much we raise and what we got last
      year. I can fetch them to you so you can see. He is a good farmer, and he
      will catch on to the melons pretty quick. We'll do better next year, and
      I'll try to keep him from belonging to things and spending money; and if
      he won't lend to anybody or start in raising a new kind of crop just when
      we get the melons going, he will make money sure. He is awful good and
      honest. All the trouble with him is he needs somebody to take care of him.
      If Aunt Lizzie had been alive he never would have lent that dead-beat
      Richards that money. He ought to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown did not feel called on to say anything. Tim continued in a
      judicial way: &ldquo;He is awful good and kind, always gets up in the morning to
      make the fire if I have got something else to do; and he'd think
      everything his wife did was the best in the world; and if he had somebody
      to take care of him he'd make money. I don't suppose YOU would think of
      it?&rdquo; This last in an insinuating tone, with evident anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; said Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she was more offended or amused she couldn't tell; and she stood
      staring at him by the electric light. To her amazement the hard little
      face began to twitch. &ldquo;I didn't mean to mad you,&rdquo; Tim grunted, with a
      quiver in his rough voice. &ldquo;I've been listening to every word you said,
      and I thought you were so sensible you'd talk over things without
      nonsense. Of course I knew he'd have to come and see you Saturday nights,
      and take you buggy riding, and take you to the theatre, and all such
      things&mdash;first. But I thought we could sorter fix it up between
      ourselves. I've taken care of him ever since Aunt Lizzie died, and I did
      my best he shouldn't lend that money, but I couldn't help it; and I did
      keep him from marrying a widow woman with eight children, who kept telling
      him how much her poor fatherless children needed a man; and I never did
      see anybody I was willing&mdash;before&mdash;and it's&mdash;it's so
      lonesome without Aunt Lizzie!&rdquo; He choked and frowned. Poor Tim, who had
      sold so many melons to women and seen so much of back doors and kitchen
      humors that he held the sex very cheap, he did not realize how hard he
      would find it to talk of the one woman who had been kind to him! He turned
      red with shame over his own weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor little chap!&rdquo; cried Miss Brown; &ldquo;you poor little sharp, innocent
      chap!&rdquo; The hand she laid on his shoulder patted it as she went on: &ldquo;Never
      mind, if I can't marry your uncle, I can help you take care of him. You're
      a real nice boy, and I'm not mad; don't you think it. There's your uncle
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson found her so gentle that he began to have qualms lest his carefully
      prepared speech should hurt her feelings. But there was no help for it
      now. &ldquo;I have thought over your kind offer to me, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, humbly,
      &ldquo;and I got a proposition to make to you. It is your honest due to have
      your farm, yes, ma'am. Well, I know a man would like to buy it; I'll sell
      it to him, and pay you your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that wasn't my proposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, ma'am. I honor you for your kindness; but I can't risk what&mdash;what
      might be another person's idea of duty about Richards. Our consciences
      ain't all equally enlightened, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown did not answer a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove along the streets where the lanterns were fading. Tim grew
      uneasy, she was silent so long. On the brow of the hill she indicated a
      side street and told them to stop the horse before a little brown house.
      One of the windows was a dim square of red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't quite so lonesome coming home to a light,&rdquo; said Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Nelson cramped the wheel to jump out to help her from the vehicle, the
      light from the electric arc fell full on his handsome face and showed her
      the look of compassion and admiration, there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one moment,&rdquo; she said, detaining him with one firm hand. &ldquo;I've got
      something to say to you. Let Richards go for the present; all I ask of you
      about him is that you will do nothing until we can find out if he is so
      bad off. But, Mr. Forrest, I can do better for you about that mortgage.
      Mr. Lossing will take it for three years for a relative of his and pay me
      the money. I told him the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And YOU will get the money all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same. I was only trying to help you a little by the other way,
      and I failed. Never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how you make me feel,&rdquo; said Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let him bring you some melons to-morrow and make a stagger at it,
      though,&rdquo; said Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; Nelson's eyes shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to,&rdquo; said Miss Brown. She laughed; but in a moment she
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way home Nelson saw the same face of Failure between the old
      mare's white ears; but its grim lineaments were softened by a smile, a
      smile like Miss Brown's.

    <h2>
      TOMMY AND THOMAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was while Harry Lossing was at the High School that Mrs. Carriswood
      first saw Tommy Fitzmaurice. He was not much to see, a long lad of sixteen
      who had outgrown his jackets and was not yet grown to his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period Mrs. Fitzmaurice was his barber, and she, having been too
      rash with the shears in one place, had snipped off the rest of his curly
      black locks &ldquo;to match;&rdquo; until he showed a perfect convict's poll, giving
      his ears all the better chance, and bringing out the rather square contour
      of his jaws to advantage. He had the true Irish-Norman face; a skin of
      fine texture, fair and freckled, high cheekbones, straight nose, and wide
      blue eyes that looked to be drawn with ink, because of their sharply
      pencilled brows and long, thick, black lashes. But the feature that Mrs.
      Carriswood noticed was Tommy's mouth, a flexible and delicately cut mouth,
      of which the lips moved lightly in speaking and seldom were quite in
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The genuine Irish orator's mouth,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Carriswood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy, however, was not a finished orator, and Mrs. Carriswood herself
      deigned to help him with his graduating oration; Tommy delivering the
      aforesaid oration from memory, on the stage of the Grand Opera House, to a
      warm-hearted and perspiring audience of his towns-people, amid tremendous
      applause and not the slightest prod-dings of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really the speech deserved the applause; Mrs. Carriswood, who had heard
      half the eloquence of the world, spent three evenings on it; and she has a
      good memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her part in the affair always amused her; though, in fact, it came to pass
      easily. She had the great fortune of the family. Being a widow with no
      children, and the time not being come when philanthropy beckons on the
      right hand and on the left to free-handed women, Mrs. Carriswood
      travelled. As she expressed it, she was searching the globe for a perfect
      climate. &ldquo;Not that I in the least expect to find it,&rdquo; said she,
      cheerfully, &ldquo;but I like to vary my disappointments; when I get worn out
      being frozen, winters, I go somewhere to be soaked.&rdquo; She was on her way to
      California this time, with her English maid, who gave the Lossing
      domestics many a jolly moment by her inextinguishable panic about red
      Indians. Mrs. Derry supposed these savages to be lurking on the prairie
      outside every Western town; and almost fainted when she did chance to turn
      the corner upon three Kickapoo Indians, splendid in paint and feathers,
      and peacefully vending the &ldquo;Famous Kickapoo Sagwa.&rdquo; She had others of the
      artless notions of the travelling English, and I fear that they were
      encouraged not only by the cook, the &ldquo;second girl,&rdquo; and the
      man-of-all-work, but by Harry and his chum, Tommy; I know she used to tell
      how she saw tame buffalo &ldquo;roosting&rdquo; on the streets, &ldquo;w'ich they do look
      that like common cows a body couldn't tell 'em hapart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a great opinion of Tommy, a mystery to her mistress for a long
      time, until one day it leaked out that Tommy &ldquo;and Master Harry, too,&rdquo; had
      told her that Tommy's great-grandfather was a lord in the old country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family seem to have sunk in the world since, Derry,&rdquo; was Mrs.
      Carriswood's single remark, as she smiled to herself. After Derry was
      dismissed she picked up a letter, written that day to a friend of hers,
      and read some passages about Harry and Tommy, smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry&rdquo;&mdash;one may look over her pretty shoulder without impertinence,
      in a story&mdash;&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;is a boy that I long to steal. Just
      the kind of boy we have both wanted, Sarah&mdash;frank, happy,
      affectionate. I must tell you something about him. It came out by
      accident. He has the Western business instincts, and what do you suppose
      he did? He actually started a wee shop of his own in the corner of the
      yard (really it is a surprisingly pretty place, and they are quite
      civilized in the house, gas, hot water, steam heat, all most comfortable),
      and sold 'pop' and candy and cakes to the boys. He made so much money that
      he proposed a partnership to the cook and the setting up a little booth in
      the 'county fair,' which is like our rural cattle shows, you know. The
      cook (a superior person who borrows books from Mrs. Lossing, but seems
      very decent and respectful notwithstanding, and broils game to perfection.
      And SUCH game as we have here, Sarah!)&mdash;well, the cook made him
      cream-cakes, sandwiches, tarts, and candy, and Harry honorably bought all
      the provisions with his profits from the first venture. You will open your
      eyes at his father permitting such a thing, but Henry Lossing is a
      thorough Westerner in some ways, and he looks on it all as a joke. 'Might
      show the boy how to do business,' he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they had a ravishing display, so Alma, the cook, and William, the
      man, assured me&mdash;per Derry. All the sadder its fate; for alas! a gang
      of rowdy boys fell upon Harry, and while he was busy fighting half of them&mdash;he
      is as plucky as his uncle, the general&mdash;the other half looted the
      beautiful stock in trade! They would have despoiled our poor little
      merchant entirely but for the opportune arrival of a schoolmate who is
      mightily respected by the rowdies. He knocked one of them down and shouted
      after the others that he would give every one of them a good thrashing if
      they did not bring the plunder back; and as he is known to be a lad of his
      word for good or evil, actually the scamps did return most of the booty,
      which the two boys brushed off and sold, as far as it went (!) The
      consequence of the fray has been that Harry is unboundedly grateful to
      this Tommy Fitzmaurice, and is at present coaching him on his graduating
      oration. Fitzmaurice has studied hard and won honors, and wants to make a
      show with his oration, to please his father. 'You see,' says Harry,
      'Tommy's father has saved money and is spending it all on Tommy, so's he
      can be educated. He needs Tommy in the business real bad, but he won't let
      him come in; he keeps him at school, and he thinks everything of his
      getting the valedictory, and Tommy, he worked nights studying to get it.'
      When I asked what was the father's business, Harry grew a bit confused.
      'Well, he kept a saloon; but'&mdash;Harry hastened to explain&mdash;'it
      was a very nice saloon, never any trouble with the police there; why,
      Tommy knew every man on the force. And they keep good liquors, too,' said
      Harry, earnestly; 'throw away all the beer left in the glasses.' 'What
      else would they do with it?' asked innocent I. 'Why, keep it in a bucket,'
      said Harry, solemnly, 'and then slip the glass under the counter and half
      fill out of the bucket, then hold it under the keg LOW, so's the foam will
      come; that's a trick of the trade, you know. Tommy says his father would
      SCORN that!' There is a vista opened, isn't there? I was rather shocked at
      such associates for Harry, and told his mother. Did she think it a good
      idea to have such a boy coming to the house? a saloon-keeper's son? She
      did not laugh, as I half expected, but answered quite seriously that she
      had been looking up Tommy, that he was very much attached to Harry, and
      that she did not think he would teach him anything bad. He has, I find
      myself, notions of honor, though they are rather the code of the street.
      And he picks up things quickly. Once he came to tea. It was amusing to see
      how he glued his eyes on Harry and kept time with his motions. He used his
      fork quite properly, only as Harry is a left-handed little fellow, the
      right-handed Thomas had the more difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is taking such vast pains with his 'oration' that I felt moved to help
      him. The subject is 'The Triumph of Democracy,' and Tommy civilly
      explained that 'democracy' did not mean the Democratic party, but 'just
      only a government where all the poor folks can get their rights and can
      vote.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oration was the kind of spread-eagle thing you might expect; I can
      see that Tommy has formed himself on the orators of his father's
      respectable saloon. What he said in comment interested me more. 'Sure, I
      guess it is the best government, ma'am, though, of course, I got to make
      it out that way, anyhow. But we come from Ireland, and there they got the
      other kind, and me granny, she starved in the famine time, she did that&mdash;with
      the fever. Me father walked twenty mile to the Sackville's place, where
      they gave him some meal, though he wasn't one of their tenants; yes, and
      the lady told him how he would be cooking it. I never will forget that
      lady!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a dramatic opportunity: would Tommy be willing to tell that story
      in his speech? He looked at me with an odd look&mdash;or so I imagined it!
      'Why not?' says he; 'I'd as soon as not tell it to anyone of them, and why
      not to them all together?' Well, why not, when you come to think of it? So
      we have got it into the speech; and I, I myself, Sarah, am drilling young
      Demos-thenes, and he is so apt a scholar that I find myself rather
      pleasantly employed.&rdquo; Having read her letter, Mrs. Carriswood hesitated a
      second and then added Derry's information at the bottom of the page. &ldquo;I
      suppose the lordly ancestor was one of King James's creation&mdash;see
      Macaulay, somewhere in the second volume. I dare say there is a drop or
      two of good blood in the boy. He has the manners of a gentleman&mdash;but
      I don't know that I ever saw an Irishman, no matter how low in the social
      scale, who hadn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that Tommy's valedictory scored a success that is a
      tradition of the High School, and came to be printed in both the city
      papers; copies of which journals Tommy's mother has preserved sacredly to
      this day; and I have no doubt, could one find them, they would be found
      wrapped around a yellow photograph of the &ldquo;A Class&rdquo; of 1870: eight pretty
      girls in white, smiling among five solemn boys in black, and Tommy
      himself, as the valedictorian, occupying the centre of the picture in his
      new suit of broadcloth, with a rose in his buttonhole and his hair cut by
      a professional barber for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the story of the famine that really captured the audience; and
      Tommy told it well, with the true Irish fire, in a beautiful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the front seat of the parquette a little old man in a wrinkled black
      broadcloth, with a bald head and a fringe of whisker under his long chin,
      and a meek little woman, in a red Paisley shawl, wept and laughed by
      turns. They had taken the deepest interest in every essay and every
      speech. The old man clapped his large hands (which were encased in loose,
      black kid gloves) with unflagging vigor. He wore a pair of heavy boots,
      the soles of which made a noble thud on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it wonderful the like of them young craters can talk like that!&rdquo; he
      cried; &ldquo;shure, Molly, that young lady who'd the essay&mdash;where is it?&rdquo;&mdash;a
      huge black forefinger travelled down the page&mdash;&ldquo;'<i>Music, The
      Turkish Patrol</i>,' No&mdash;though that's grand, that piece; I'll be
      spakin' wid Professor Von Keinmitz to bring it when we've the opening.
      Here 'tis, Molly: '<i>Tin, Essay. The Darkest Night Brings Out the Stars,
      Miss Mamie Odenheimer</i>.' Thrue for you, mavourneen! And the sintiments,
      wasn't they illigant? and the lan-gwidge was as foine as Pat Ronan's
      speeches or Father&mdash;whist! will ye look at the flowers that shlip of
      a gyirl's gitting! Count 'em, will ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen bouquets and wan basket,&rdquo; says the little woman, &ldquo;and Mamie
      Odenheimer, she got seventeen bouquets and two baskets and a sign. Well,&rdquo;
       she looked anxious, but smiled, &ldquo;I know of siven bouquets Tommy will git
      for sure. And that's not countin' what Harry Lossing will do for him.
      Hiven bless the good heart of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I kin count four for him on wan seat,&rdquo; says the man, with a nod of
      his head toward the gay heap in the woman's lap, &ldquo;barrin' I ain't
      on-vaygled into flinging some of thim to the young ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry Lossing, in the seat behind with his mother and Mrs. Carriswood,
      giggled at this and whispered in the latter lady's ear, &ldquo;That's Tommy's
      father and mother. My, aren't they excited, though! And Tommy's white's a
      sheet&mdash;for fear he'll disappoint them, you know. He has said his
      piece over twice to me, to-day, he's so scared lest he'll forget. I've got
      it in my pocket, and I'm going behind when it's his turn, to prompt him.
      Did you see me winking at him? it sort of cheers him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was almost as keen over the floral procession as the Fitzmaurices
      themselves. The Lossing garden had been stripped to the last bud, and
      levies made on the asparagus-bed, into the bargain, and Mrs. Lossing and
      Alma and Mrs. Carriswood and Derry and Susy Lossing had made bouquets and
      baskets and wreaths, and Harry had distributed them among friends in
      different parts of the house. I say Harry, but, complimented by Mrs.
      Carriswood, he admitted ingenuously that it was Tommy's idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy thought they would make more show that way,&rdquo; says Harry, &ldquo;and they
      are all on the middle aisle, so his father and mother can see them; Tim
      O'Halloran has got one for him, too, and Mrs. Macillarney, and she's got
      some splendid pinies. Picked every last one. They'll make a show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Harry knew nothing of the most magnificent of his friend's trophies
      until it undulated gloriously down the aisle, above the heads of two men,
      white satin ribbons flying, tinfoil shining&mdash;an enormous horseshoe of
      roses and mignonette!
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents were both on their feet to crane their necks after it, as it
      passed them amid the plaudits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was YOU, Cousin Margaret; I know it was you,&rdquo; cried Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the ladies over to the Fitzmaurices the minute that the diplomas
      were given; and, directly, Tommy joined them, attended by two admiring
      followers laden with the trophies. Mrs. O'Halloran and Mrs. Macillarney
      and divers of the friends, both male and female, joined the circle. Tommy
      held quite a little court. He shook hands with all the ladies, beginning
      with Mrs. Carriswood (who certainly never had found herself before in such
      a company, jammed between Alderman McGinnis's resplendent new tweeds and
      Mrs. Macillarney's calico); he affectionately embraced his mother, and he
      allowed himself to be embraced by Mrs. Macillarney and Mrs. O'Halloran,
      while Patrick Fitzmaurice shook hands with the alderman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the lady that helped me on me piece, father; she's the lady that
      sent me the horseshoe, mother. Like to make you acquainted with me father
      and me mother. Mr. and Mrs. Fitzmaurice, Mrs. Carriswood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In these words, Tommy, blushing and happy, presented his happy parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I'm proud to meet you, ma'am,&rdquo; said Fitzmaurice, bowing, while his
      wife courtesied and wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very grateful, but they were more grateful for the flowers than
      for the oratorical drilling. No doubt they thought that their Tommy could
      have done as well in any case; but the splendid horseshoe was another
      matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years passed before Mrs. Carriswood saw her pupil again. During those
      years the town had increased and prospered; so had the Lossing Art
      Furniture Works. It was after Harry Lossing had disappointed his father.
      This is not saying that he had done anything out of the way; he had simply
      declined to be the fourth Harry Lossing on the rolls of Harvard College.
      Instead, he proposed to enter the business and to begin by learning his
      own trade. He was so industrious, he kept at it with such energy that his
      first convert was his father&mdash;no, I am wrong, Mrs. Carriswood was the
      first; Mrs. Lossing was not a convert, SHE had believed in Harry from the
      beginning. But all this was years before Mrs. Carriswood's visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of Master Harry's notions was his belief in the necessity of his
      &ldquo;meddling&rdquo;&mdash;so his father put it&mdash;in the affairs of the town,
      the state, and the nation, as well as those of the Lossing furniture
      company. But, though he was pleased to make rather cynical fun of his
      son's political enthusiasm, esteeming it in a sense a diverting and
      therefore reprehensible pursuit for a business man, the elder Lossing had
      a sneaking pride in it, all the same. He liked to bring out Harry's
      political shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy, Margaret,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;whom do you think Harry has brought over to
      our side now? The shrewdest ward politician in the town&mdash;why, you saw
      him when he was a boy&mdash;Tommy Fitzmaurice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Carriswood remembered; she asked, amused, how was Tommy and
      where was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy? Oh, he went to the State university; the old man was bound to send
      him, and he was more dutiful than some sons. He was graduated with honors,
      and came back to a large, ready-made justice court's practice. Of course
      he drifted into criminal practice; but he has made a fine income out of
      that, and is the shrewdest, some folks say the least scrupulous, political
      manager in the county. And so, Harry, you have persuaded him to cast in
      his lot with the party of principle, have you? and he is packing the
      primaries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing dishonest in our trying to get our friends out to vote at
      the primaries, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, but he may not stop there. However, I want Bailey elected,
      and I am glad he will work for us; what's his price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry blushed a little. &ldquo;I believe he would like to be city attorney,
      sir,&rdquo; said he; and Mr. Lossing laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he make a bad one?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carriswood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would make the best kind of a one,&rdquo; replied Harry, with youthful
      fervor; &ldquo;he's a ward politician and all that, I know; but he has it in him
      to be an uncommon deal more! And I say, sir, do you know that he and the
      old man will take twenty-five thousand of the stock at par if we turn
      ourselves into a corporation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about this new license measure? won't that bear a little bit hard on
      the old man?&rdquo; This from Mr. Lossing, who was biting his cigar in deep
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not prevent his doing his duty; why, the old man for very pride
      will be the first to obey the law. You'll SEE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six months later they did see, since it was mostly due to Fitzmaurice's
      efforts that the reform candidate was elected; as a consequence, Tommy
      became prosecuting attorney; and, to the amazement of the critics, made
      the best prosecuting attorney that the city had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the campaign that Mrs. Carriswood met him. Her goddaughter,
      daughter of the friend to whom years ago she described Tommy, was with
      her. This time Mrs. Carriswood had recently added Florida to her
      disappointments in climates, and was back, as she told Mrs. Lossing, &ldquo;with
      a real sense of relief in a climate that was too bad to make any
      pretensions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had brought Miss Van Harlem to see the shops. It may be that she would
      not have been averse to Harry Lossing's growing interested in young
      Margaret. She had seen a great deal of Harry while he was East at school,
      and he remained her first favorite, while Margaret was as good as she was
      pretty, and had half a million of dollars in her own right. They had seen
      Harry, and he was showing them through the different buildings or &ldquo;shops,&rdquo;
       when a man entered who greeted him cordially, and whom he presented to
      Mrs. Carriswood. It was Tommy Fitzmaurice, grown into a handsome young
      man. He brought his heels together and made the ladies a solemn bow.
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, ladies; how do you like the West?&rdquo; said Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His black locks curled about his ears, which seemed rather small now; he
      had a good nose and a mobile, clean-shaven face. His hands were very white
      and soft, and the rim of linen above them was dazzling. His black
      frock-coat was buttoned snugly about his slim waist. He brushed his face
      with a fine silk handkerchief, and thereby diffused the fragrance of the
      best imported cologne among the odors of wood and turpentine. A diamond
      pin sparkled from his neckscarf. The truth is, he knew that the visitors
      were coming and had made a state toilet. &ldquo;He looks half like an actor and
      half like a clergyman, and he IS all a politician,&rdquo; thought Mrs.
      Carriswood; &ldquo;I don't think I shall like him any more.&rdquo; While she thought,
      she was inclining her slender neck toward him, and the gentlest interest
      and pleasure beamed out of her beautiful, dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We like the West, but <i>I</i> have liked it for ten years; this is not
      my first visit,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carriswood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to be glad for that, madam. I never made another speech so
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had remembered her; she laughed. &ldquo;I had thought that you would forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I, when you have not changed at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have,&rdquo; says Mrs. Carriswood, hardly knowing whether to show the
      young man his place or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, naturally. But I have not learned how to make a speech yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you make very good ones, Harry tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, Harry. No, ma'am, Harry is a nice boy; but he doesn't know.
      I know there is a lot to learn, and I guess a lot to unlearn; and I feel
      all outside; I don't even know how to get at it. I have wished a thousand
      times that I could talk with the lady who taught me to speak in the first
      place.&rdquo; He walked on by her side, talking eagerly. &ldquo;You don't know how
      many times I have felt I would give most anything for the opportunity of
      just seeing you and talking with you; those things you said to me I always
      remembered.&rdquo; He had a hundred questions evidently stinging his tongue. And
      some of them seemed to Mrs. Carriswood very apposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm on the outside of such a lot of things,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;When I first began
      to suspect that I was on the outside was when I went to the High School,
      and sometimes I was invited to Harry's; that was my first acquaintance
      with cultivated society. You can't learn manners from books, ma'am. I
      learned them at Harry's. That is,&rdquo;&mdash;he colored and laughed,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      learned SOME. There's plenty left, I know. Then, I went to the University.
      Some of the boys came from homes like Harry's, and some of the professors
      there used to ask us to their houses; and I saw engravings and oil
      paintings, and heard the conversation of persons of culture. All this only
      makes me know enough to KNOW I am outside. I can see the same thing with
      the lawyers, too. There is a set of them that are after another kind of
      things; that think themselves above me and my sort of fellows. You know
      all the talk about this being a free and equal country. That's the tallest
      kind of humbug, madam! It is that. There are sets, one above another,
      everywhere; big bugs and little bugs, if you will excuse the expression.
      And you can't influence the big ones without knowing how they feel. A
      fellow can't be poking in the dark in a speech or anywhere else. Now,
      these fellows here, they go into politics, sometimes; and there, I tell
      you, we come the nearest to a fair field and no favor! It is the best
      fellow gets the prize there&mdash;the sharpest-witted, the nerviest, and
      stanchest. Oh, talk of machine politics! all the soft chaps who ain't
      willing to get up early in the morning, or to go out in the wet, THEY howl
      about the primaries and corruption; let them get up and clean the
      primaries instead of holding their noses! Those fellows, I'm not nice
      enough for them, but I can beat them every time. They make a monstrous
      racket in the newspapers, but when election comes on they can't touch
      side, edge, or bottom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Discoursing in this fashion, with digressions to Harry in regard to the
      machines, the furniture, and the sales, that showed Mrs. Carriswood that
      he meant to keep an eye on his twenty odd thousand dollars, he strolled at
      her side. To Miss Van Harlem he scarcely said three words. In fact, he
      said exactly three words, uttered as Miss Margaret's silken skirts swung
      too near a pot of varnish. They were &ldquo;Look out, miss!&rdquo; and at the same
      second, Tommy (who was in advance, with really no call to know of the
      danger), turned on his heel and whisked the skirts away, turning back to
      pick up the sentence he had dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy told Harry that Miss Van Harlem was a very handsome lady, but
      haughty-looking. Then he talked for half an hour about the cleverness of
      Mrs. Carriswood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to think Tommy will rise.&rdquo; (Mrs. Carriswood was describing
      the interview to her cousin, the next day.) &ldquo;What do you think he said to
      me last of all? 'How,' said he, 'does a man, a gentleman'&mdash;it had a
      touch of the pathetic, don't you know, the little hesitation he made on
      the word&mdash;'how does he show his gratitude to a lady who has done him
      a great service?' 'Young or old?' I said. 'Oh, a married lady,' he said,
      'very much admired, who has been everywhere.' Wasn't that clever of him? I
      told him that a man usually sent a few flowers. You saw the basket to-day&mdash;evidently
      regardless of expense. And fancy, there was a card, a card with a gilt
      edge and his name written on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The card was his mother's. She has visiting cards, now, and pays visits
      once a year in a livery carriage. Poor Mrs. Fitzmaurice, she is always so
      scared; and she is such a good soul! Tommy is very good to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the father? Does he still keep that 'nice' saloon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he talks of retiring. They are not poor at all, and Tommy is
      their only child; the others died. It is hard on the old man to retire,
      for he isn't so very old in fact, but if he once is convinced that his
      calling stands in the way of Tommy's career, he won't hesitate a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor people,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carriswood; &ldquo;do you know, Grace, I can see
      Tommy's future; he will grow to be a boss, a political boss. He will
      become rich by keeping your streets always being cleaned&mdash;which means
      never clean&mdash;and giving you the worst fire department and police to
      be obtained for money; and, by and by, a grateful machine will make him
      mayor, or send him to the Legislature, very likely to Congress, where he
      will misrepresent the honest State of Iowa. Then he will bloom out in a
      social way, and marry a gentlewoman, and they will snub the old people who
      are so proud of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lossing; &ldquo;I think better things of Tommy.
      So does Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Part of the prophecy was to be speedily fulfilled. Two years later, the
      Honorable Thomas Fitzmaurice was elected mayor of his city, elected by the
      reform party, on account of his eminent services&mdash;and because he was
      the only man in sight who had the ghost of a chance of winning. Harry's
      version was: &ldquo;Tommy jests at his new principles, but that is simply
      because he doesn't comprehend what they are. He laughs at reform in the
      abstract; but every concrete, practical reform he is as anxious as I or
      anybody to bring about. And he will get them here, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his word; he gave the city an admirable administration,
      with neither fear nor favor. Some of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; still clung to him; these,
      according to Harry, were the better &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; who had the seeds of good in
      them and only needed opportunity and a leader. Tommy did not flag in zeal;
      rather, as the time went on and he soared out of the criminal courts into
      big civil cases involving property, he grew up to the level of his
      admirers' praises. &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Lossing, presently, &ldquo;is beginning to
      take himself seriously. He has been told so often that he is a young lion
      of reform, that he begins to study the role in dead earnest. I don't talk
      this way to Harry, who believes in him and is training him for the
      representative for our district. What harm? Verily, his is the faith that
      will move mountains. Besides, Tommy is now rich; he must be worth a
      hundred thousand dollars, which makes a man of wealth in these parts. It
      is time for him to be respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this preparation, Mrs. Carriswood (then giving Washington
      the benefit of her doubts of climate) was surprised one day to receive a
      perfectly correct visiting card whereon was engraved, &ldquo;Mr. Thomas
      Sackville Fitzmaurice, M.C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady who was with her lifted her brilliant hazel eyes and half
      smiled. &ldquo;Is it the droll young man we met once at Mrs. Lossing's? Pray see
      him, Aunt Margaret,&rdquo; said Miss Van Harlem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carriswood shrugged her shoulders and ordered the man to show him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There entered, in the wake of the butler, a distinguished-looking
      personage who held out his hand with a perfect copy of the bow that she
      saw forty times a day. &ldquo;He is taking himself very seriously,&rdquo; she sighed;
      &ldquo;he is precisely like anybody else!&rdquo; And she felt her interest snuffed out
      by Tommy's correctness. But, directly, she changed her mind; the unfailing
      charm of his race asserted itself in Tommy; she decided that he was a
      delightful, original young man, and in ten minutes they were talking in
      the same odd confidence that had always marked their relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly you are gotten up! Are you INSIDE, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, do you remember that?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that's awfully good of you. Which is
      so fortunate as to please you, my clothes or my deportment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both. They are very good. Where did you get them, Tommy? I shall take the
      privilege of my age and call you Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. The clothes? Oh, I asked Harry for the proper thing, and he
      recommended a tailor. I think Harry gave me the manners, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your new principles?&rdquo; She could not resist this little fling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe a great deal in that way to Harry, also,&rdquo; answered he, with
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone were the days of sarcastic ridicule, of visionary politics. Tommy
      talked of the civil service in the tone of Harry himself. He was actually
      eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Margaret, he is a remarkable young man,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Van
      Harlem; &ldquo;his honesty and enthusiasm are refreshing in this pessimist
      place. I hope he will come again. Did you notice what lovely eyes he has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before long it was not pure good-nature that caused Mrs. Carriswood to ask
      Fitzmaurice to her house. He was known as a rising young man, One met him
      at the best houses; yet he was a prodigious worker, and had made his mark
      in committees, before the celebrated speech that sent him into all the
      newspaper columns, or that stubborn and infinitely versatile fight against
      odds which inspired the artist of PUCK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy bore the cartoon to Mrs. Carriswood, beaming. She had not seen that
      light in his face since the memorable June afternoon in the Opera-house.
      He sent the paper to his mother, who vowed the picture &ldquo;did not favor
      Tommy at all, at all. Sure Tommy never had such a red nose!&rdquo; The old man,
      however, went to his ex-saloon, and sat in state all the morning, showing
      Tommy's funny picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time that Mrs. Carriswood observed something that took
      her breath away: Tommy Fitzmaurice had the presumption to be attentive to
      my lady's goddaughter, Miss Van Harlem. Nor was this the worst; there were
      indications that Miss Van Harlem, who had refused the noble names and
      titles of two or three continental nobles, and the noble name
      unaccompanied by a title of the younger son of an English earl, without
      mentioning the half-dozen &ldquo;nice&rdquo; American claimants&mdash;Miss Van Harlem
      was not angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day this staggering blow fell on her, Mrs. Carriswood was in her
      dressing-room, peacefully watching Derry unpack a box from Paris, in
      anticipation of a state dinner. And Miss Van Harlem, in a bewitching
      wrapper, sat on the lounge and admired. Upon this scene of feminine peace
      and happiness enter the Destroyer, in the shape of a note from Tommy
      Fitzmaurice! Were they going on Beatoun's little excursion to Alexandria?
      If they were, he would move heaven and earth to put off a committee
      meeting, in order to join them. By the way, he was to get the floor for
      his speech that afternoon. Wouldn't Mrs. Carriswood come to inspire him?
      Perhaps Miss Van Harlem would not be bored by a little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a well-worded note; as Mrs. Carriswood read it she realized for the
      first time how completely Tommy was acclimated in society. She remembered
      his plaint years ago, and his awe of &ldquo;oil paintings&rdquo; and &ldquo;people of
      culture;&rdquo; and she laughed half-sadly as she passed the note over to Miss
      Van Harlem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume it is the Alexandria excursion that the Beatouns were talking
      about yesterday,&rdquo; she said, languidly. &ldquo;He wants to show that young
      Irishman that we have a mild flavor of antiquity, ourselves. We are to see
      Alexandria and have a real old Virginian dinner, including one of the
      famous Beatoun hams and some of the '69 Chateau Yquem and the sacred '47
      port. I suppose he will have the four-in-hand buckboard. 'A small party '&mdash;that
      will mean the Honorable Basil Sackville, Mrs. Beatoun, Lilly Denning,
      probably one of the Cabinet girls, Colonel Turner, and that young Russian
      Beatoun is so fond of, Tommy Fitzmaurice&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you always call Mr. Fitzmaurice Tommy?&rdquo;&mdash;this interruption
      comes with a slight rise of color from young Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody calls him Tommy in his own town; a politician as popular as he
      with the boys is naturally Tommy or Jerry or Billy. They slap him on the
      back or sit with an arm around his neck and concoct the ways to rule us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think anyone slaps Mr. Fitzmaurice on the back and calls him
      Tommy, NOW,&rdquo; says Margaret, with a little access of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say his poor old father and mother don't venture on that liberty;
      I wish you had seen them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told me about them,&rdquo; says Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Carriswood's dismay was such that for a second she simply gasped.
      Were things so far along that such confessions were made? Tommy must be
      very confident to venture; it was shrewd, very shrewd, to forestall Mrs.
      Carriswood's sure revelations&mdash;oh, Tommy was not a politician for
      nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Margaret went on, with the same note of repressed feeling in
      her voice, &ldquo;his is a good family, if they have decayed; his ancestor was
      Lord Fitzmaurice in King James's time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She takes HIM seriously too!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Carriswood, with inexpressible
      consternation; &ldquo;what SHALL I say to her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, perhaps, considering that she was so frankly a woman of
      the world, her stub-bornest objection to Tommy was not an objection of
      expediency. She had insensibly grown to take his success for granted, like
      the rest of the Washington world; he would be a governor, a senator, he
      might be&mdash;anything! And he was perfectly presentable, now; no, it
      would be on the whole an investment in the future that would pay well
      enough; his parents would be awkward, but they were old people, not likely
      to be too much <i>en evidence</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carriswood, while not overjoyed, would not feel crushed by such a
      match, but she did view what she regarded as Tommy's moral instability,
      with a dubious and fearful eye. He was earnest enough for his new
      principles now; but what warrant was there of his sincerity? Margaret and
      her mother were high-minded women. It was the gallant knight of her party
      and her political faith that the girl admired, the valiant fight, not the
      triumph! No mere soldier of fortune, no matter how successful or how
      brilliant, could win her; if Tommy were the mercenary, not the knight, no
      worldly glory could compensate his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore, after a bad quarter of an hour reflecting on these things, Mrs.
      Carriswood went to the Capitol, resolved to take her goddaughter away. She
      would not withdraw her acceptance of the Beatouns' invitation, no; let the
      Iowa congressman have every opportunity to display his social shortcomings
      in contrast with the accomplished Russian, and Jack Turner, the most
      elegant man in the army; the next day would be time enough for a telegram
      and a sudden flitting. Yet in the midst of her plans for Tommy's
      discomfiture she was assailed by a queer regret and reluctance. Tommy's
      fascination had affected even a professional critic of life; he had been
      so amusing, so willing, so trusting, so useful, that her chill interest
      had warmed into liking. She felt a moving of the heart as the handsome
      black head arose, and the first notes of that resonant, thrilling voice
      swelled above the din on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the day of his great speech, the speech that made him, it was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Carriswood sank back, turning a little in an instinctive effort to
      repulse her own sympathy, she was aware of the presence near her of an
      elderly man and woman. The old man wore a shining silk hat and shining new
      black clothes. His expansive shirt-bosom was very white, but not glossy,
      and rumpled in places; and his collar was of the spiked and antique
      pattern known as a &ldquo;dickey.&rdquo; His wrinkled, red face was edged by a white
      fringe of whisker. He wore large gold-bowed spectacles, and his jaws
      worked incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was a little, mild, wrinkled creature, with an anxious blue eye
      and snowy hair, smoothed down over her ears, under her fine bonnet. She
      was richly dressed, but her silks and velvets ill suited the season. Had
      she seen them anywhere else, Mrs. Carriswood might not have recognized
      them; but there, with Tommy before them, both of them feverishly absorbed
      in Tommy, she recognized them at a glance. She had a twinge of pity,
      watching the old faces pale and kindle. With the first rustle of applause,
      she saw the old father slip his hand into the old mother's. They sat well
      behind a pillar; and however excited they became, they never so lost
      themselves as to lean in front of their shield. This, also, she noticed.
      The speech over, the woman wiped her eyes. The old man joined in the
      tumult of applause that swept over the galleries, but the old woman pulled
      his arm, evidently feeling that it was not decent for them to applaud. She
      sat rigid, with red cheeks and her eyes brimming; he was swaying and
      clapping and laughing in a roar of delight. But it was he that drew her
      away, finally, while she fain would have lingered to look at Tommy
      receiving congratulations below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carriswood, &ldquo;I do believe they haven't let him
      know that they are here.&rdquo; And she remembered how she had pitied them for
      this very possibility of humiliation years before. But she did not pursue
      the adventure, and some obscure motive prevented her speaking of it to
      Miss Van Harlem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Tommy's parents tell Tommy? If they did, Tommy made no sign. The
      morning found him with the others, in a beautiful white flannel suit, with
      a silk shirt and a red silk sash, looking handsomer than any man of the
      party. He took the congratulations of the company modestly. Either he was
      not much puffed up, or he had the art of concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw Alexandria in a conscientious fashion, for the benefit of the
      guest of the day. He was a modest young fellow with a nose rather too
      large for his face, a long upper lip, and frank blue eyes. He made himself
      agreeable to one of the Cabinet girls, on the front seat, while Tommy,
      just behind him, had Miss Van Harlem and bliss for his portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old streets, the toppling roofs, the musty warehouses, the uneven
      pavement, all pleased the young creatures out in the sunshine. They made
      merry over the ancient ball-room, where Washington had asked a far-away
      ancestress of Beatoun to dance; and they decorously walked through the old
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      IT happened in the church. Mrs. Carriswood was behind the others; so she
      saw them come in, the same little old couple of the Capitol.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chancel, Beatoun was explaining; beside Beatoun shone a curly black
      head that they knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Carriswood sat in one of the high old pews. Through a crack she could
      look into the next pew; and there they stood. She heard the old man:
      &ldquo;Whist, Molly, let's be getting out of this! HE is here with all his grand
      friends. Don't let us be interrupting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman's voice was so like Tommy's that it made Mrs. Carriswood
      start. Very softly she spoke: &ldquo;I only want to look at him a minute, Pat,
      jest a minute. I ain't seen him for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it any longer for you than for me?&rdquo; retorted the husband. &ldquo;Ye know
      what ye promised if I'd be taking you here, unbeknownst. Don't look his
      way! Look like ye was a stranger to him. Don't let us be mortifying him
      wid our country ways. Like as not 'tis the prisidint, himself, he is
      colloguein' wid, this blessed minute. Shtep back and be a stranger to him,
      woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stranger to him, his own mother! But she stepped back; she turned her
      patient face. Then&mdash;Tommy saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of red flushed all over his face. He took two steps down the aisle,
      and caught the little figure in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why, mother, where did you drop from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before Mrs. Carriswood could speak she saw him step back and push
      young Sackville forward, crying, &ldquo;This is my father, this is the boy that
      knew your grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did it so easily; he was so entirely unaffected, so perfectly
      unconscious, that there was nothing at all embarrassing for anyone. Even
      the Cabinet girl, with a grandmother in very humble life, who must be kept
      in the background, could not feel disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this happy result Mrs. Carriswood owns a share of the credit. She
      advanced on the first pause, and claimed acquaintanceship with the
      Fitzmaurices. The story of their last meeting and Tommy's first triumph in
      oratory came, of course; the famous horseshoe received due mention; and
      Tommy described with much humor his terror of the stage. From the speech
      to its most effective passage was a natural transition; equally natural
      the transition to Tommy's grandmother, the Irish famine, and the
      benevolence of Lady Sackville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was interested, and it was Sackville himself, who brought the
      Fitzmaurices' noble ancestors, the apocryphal Viscounts Fitzmaurice of
      King James's creation, on to the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was entirely serious. &ldquo;My grandmother told me of your
      great-grandfather, Lord Fitzmaurice; she saw him ride to hounds once, when
      she was a little girl. They say he was the boldest rider in Ireland, and a
      renowned duellist too. King James gave the title to his grandfather,
      didn't he? and the countryside kept it, if it was given rather too late in
      the day to be useful. I am glad you have restored the family fortunes, Mr.
      Fitzmaurice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cabinet girl looked on Tommy with respect, and Miss Van Harlem blushed
      like an angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is lost,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carriswood to herself; yet she smiled. Going
      home, she found a word for Tommy's ear. The old Virginian dinner had been
      most successful. The Fitzmaurices (who had been almost forced into the
      banquet by Beatoun's imperious hospitality) were not a wet blanket in the
      least. Patrick Fitzmaurice, brogue and all, was an Irish gentleman without
      a flaw. He blossomed out into a modest wag; and told two or three comic
      stories as acceptably as he was used to tell them to a very different
      circle&mdash;only, carrying a fresher flavor of wit to this circle,
      perhaps, it enjoyed them more. Mrs. Fitzmaurice looked scared and ate
      almost nothing, with the greatest propriety, and her fork in her left
      hand. Yet even she thawed under Miss Van Harlem's attentions and gentle
      Mrs. Beatoun's tact, and the winning ways of the last Beatoun baby. She
      took this absent cherub to her heart with such undissembled warmth that
      its mother ever since has called her &ldquo;a sweet, funny little old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both (Patrick and his wife) quite unassuming and retiring, and
      no urging could dissuade them from parting with the company at the tavern
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, Tommy, your mother and I can git home by ourselves,&rdquo; whispered
      honest Patrick; &ldquo;we've not exceeded&mdash;if the wines WERE good. I never
      exceeded in my life, God take the glory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he embraced Tommy so affectionately in parting that I confess Mrs.
      Carriswood had suspicions. Yet, surely, it is more likely that his brain
      was&mdash;let us not say TURNED, but just a wee bit TILTED, by the joy and
      triumph of the occasion rather than by Beatoun's port or champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Carriswood's word had nothing to do with Tommy's parents,
      ostensibly, though, in truth, it had everything to do. She said: &ldquo;Will you
      dine with us to-morrow, quite <i>en famille</i>, Thomas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to tell you, I suppose, that I find your house a pretty dangerous
      paradise, Mrs. Carriswood,&rdquo; says Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I find you a most dangerous angel, Thomas; but&mdash;you see I ask
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answers Tommy, in a different tone; &ldquo;you've always been an
      angel to me. What I owe to you and Harry Lossing&mdash;well, I can't talk
      about it. But see here, Mrs. Carriswood, you always have called me Tommy;
      now you say Thomas; why this state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have won your brevet, Thomas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled, and she liked him the better that he should not make
      enough of his conduct to understand her; but, though she has called him
      Tommy often since, he keeps the brevet in her thoughts. In fact, Mrs.
      Carriswood is beginning to take the Honorable Thomas Fitzmaurice and his
      place in the world seriously, herself.

      MOTHER EMERITUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE Louders lived on the second floor, at the head of the stairs, in the
      Lossing Building. There is a restaurant to the right; and a new doctor,
      every six months, who is every kind of a healer except &ldquo;regular,&rdquo; keeps
      the permanent boarders in gossip, to the left; two or three dressmakers, a
      dentist, and a diamond merchant up-stairs, one flight; and half a dozen
      families and a dozen single tenants higher&mdash;so you see the Louders
      had plenty of neighbors. In fact, the multitude of the neighbors is one
      cause of my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilly Louder came home from the Lossing factory (where she is a
      typewriter) one February afternoon. As she turned the corner, she was face
      to the river, which is not so full of shipping in winter that one cannot
      see the steel-blue glint of the water. Back of her the brick paved street
      climbed the hill, under a shapeless arch of trees. The remorseless pencil
      of a railway has drawn black lines at the foot of the hill; and, all day
      and all night, slender red bars rise and sink in their black sockets, to
      the accompaniment of the outcry of tortured steam. All day, if not all
      night, the crooked pole slips up and down the trolley wire, as the yellow
      cars rattle, and flash, and clang a spiteful little bell, that sounds like
      a soprano bark, over the crossings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is customary in the Lossing Building to say, &ldquo;We are so handy to the
      cars.&rdquo; The street is a handsome street, not free from dingy old brick
      boxes of stores below the railway, but fast replacing them with fairer
      structures. The Lossing Building has the wide arches, the recessed doors,
      the balconies and the colonnades of modern business architecture. The
      occupants are very proud of the balconies, in particular; and, summer
      days, these will be a mass of greenery and bright tints. To-day, it was so
      warm, February day though it was, that some of the potted plants were
      sunning themselves outside the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilly could see them if she craned her neck. There were some bouvardias
      and fuchsias of her mother's among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS a pretty building,&rdquo; said Tilly; and, for some reason, she frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a young woman, but not a very young woman. Her figure was slim,
      and she looked better in loose waists than in tightly fitted gowns. She
      wore a dark green gown with a black jacket, and a scarlet shirt-waist
      underneath. Her face was long, with square chin and high cheek-bones, and
      thin, firm lips; yet she was comely, because of her lustrous black hair,
      her clear, gray eyes, and her charming, fair skin. She had another gift:
      everything about her was daintily neat; at first glance one said, &ldquo;Here is
      a person who has spent pains, if not money, on her toilet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Tilly was entering the Lossing Building. Half-way up the
      stairway a hand plucked her skirts. The hand belonged to a tired-faced
      woman in black, on whose breast glittered a little crowd of pins and
      threaded needles, like the insignia of an Order of Toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please excuse me, Miss Tilly,&rdquo; said the woman, at the same time
      presenting a flat package in brown paper, &ldquo;but WILL you give this pattern
      back to your mother. I am so very much obliged. I don't know how I WOULD
      git along without your mother, Tilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give the pattern to her,&rdquo; said Tilly, and she pursued her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very far. A stout woman and a thin young man, with long, wavy, red
      hair, awaited her on the landing. The woman held a plate of cake which she
      thrust at Tilly the instant they were on the same level, saying: &ldquo;The cake
      was just splendid, tell your mother; it's a lovely recipe, and will you
      tell her to take this, and see how well I succeeded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss Louder,&rdquo; said the man, as the stout woman rustled
      away, &ldquo;here are some <i>Banner of Lights;</i> I think she'd be interested
      in some of the articles on the true principles of the inspirational faith&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Tilly placed the bundle of newspapers at the base of her load&mdash;&ldquo;and&mdash;and,
      I wish you'd tell your dear mother that, under the angels, her mustard
      plaster really saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell her,&rdquo; said Tilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had advanced a little space before a young girl in a bright blue silk
      gown flung a radiant presence between her and the door. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Tilly,&rdquo;
       she murmured, blushing, &ldquo;will you just give your mother this?&mdash;it's&mdash;it's
      Jim's photograph. You tell her it's ALL right; and SHE was exactly right,
      and <i>I</i> was wrong. She'll understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly, with a look of resignation, accepted a stiff package done up in
      white tissue paper. She had now only three steps to take: she took two,
      only two, for&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Tilly, PLEASE!&rdquo; a voice pealed around the
      corner, while a flushed and breathless young woman, with a large baby
      toppling over her lean shoulder, staggered into view. &ldquo;My!&rdquo; she panted,
      &ldquo;ain't it tiresome lugging a child! I missed the car, of course, coming
      home from ma's. Oh, say, Tilly, your mother was so good, she said she'd
      tend Blossom next time I went to the doctor's, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the baby,&rdquo; said Tilly. She hoisted the infant on to her own
      shoulder with her right arm. &ldquo;Perhaps you'll be so kind's to turn the
      handle of the door,&rdquo; said she in a slightly caustic tone, &ldquo;as I haven't
      got any hands left. Please shut it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the young mother opened the door, Tilly entered the parlor. For a
      second she stood and stared grimly about her. The furniture of the room
      was old-fashioned but in the best repair. There was a cabinet organ in one
      corner. A crayon portrait of Tilly's father (killed in the civil war)
      glared out of a florid gilt frame. Perhaps it was the fault of the
      portrait, but he had a peevish frown. There were two other portraits of
      him, large ghastly gray tintypes in oval frames of rosewood, obscurely
      suggesting coffins. In these he looked distinctly sullen. He was
      represented in uniform (being a lieutenant of volunteers), and the artist
      had conscientiously gilded his buttons until, as Mrs. Louder was wont to
      observe, &ldquo;It most made you want to cut them off with the scissors.&rdquo; There
      were other tintypes and a flock of photographs in the room. What Mrs.
      Louder named &ldquo;a throw&rdquo; decorated each framed picture and each chair. The
      largest arm-chair was drawn up to a table covered with books and
      magazines: in the chair sat Mrs. Louder, reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Tilly's entrance she started and turned her head, and then one could
      see that the tears were streaming down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, MOTHER!&rdquo; exploded Tilly. Kicking the door open, she marched into the
      bed-chamber. An indignant sweep of one arm sent the miscellany of gifts
      into a rocking-chair; an indignant curve of the other landed the baby on
      the bed. Tilly turned on her mother. &ldquo;Now, mother, what did you promise&mdash;HUSH!
      will you?&rdquo; (The latter part of the sentence a fierce &ldquo;ASIDE&rdquo; to the infant
      on the bed.) In a second Mrs. Louder's arms were encircling him, and she
      was soothing him on her broad shoulder, where I know not how many babies
      have found comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Louder was a tall woman&mdash;tall and portly. She had a massive
      repose about her, a kind of soft dignity; and a stranger would not guess
      how tender was her heart. Deprecatingly she looked up at her only child,
      standing in judgment over her. Her eyes were fine still, though they had
      sparkled and wept for more than half a century. They were not gray, like
      Tilly's, but a deep violet, with black eyelashes and eyebrows. Black,
      once, had been the hair under the widow's cap, now streaked with silver;
      but Jane Louder's skin was fresh and daintily tinted like her daughter's,
      for all its fine wrinkles. Her voice when she spoke was mellow and slow,
      with a nervous vibration of apology. &ldquo;Never mind, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was
      just reading 'bout the Russians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I KNEW it! You promised me you wouldn't cry about the Russians any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Tilly, but Alma Brown lent this to me, herself. There's a
      beautiful article in it about 'The Horrors of Hunger.' It would make your
      heart ache! I wish you would read it, Tilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I don't care to have my heart ache. I'm not going to read
      any more horrors about the Russians, or hear them either, if I can help
      it. I have to write Mr. Lossing's letters about them, and that's enough.
      I've given all I can afford, and you've given more than you can afford;
      and I helped get up the subscription at the shops. I've done all I could;
      and now I ain't going to have my feelings harrowed up any more, when it
      won't do me nor the Russians a mite of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cayn't HELP it, Tilly. I cayn't take any comfort in my meals,
      thinking of that awful black bread the poor children starve rather than
      eat; and, Tilly, they ain't so dirty as some folks think! I read in a
      magazine how they have GOT to bathe twice a week by their religion; and
      there's a bath-house in every village. Tilly, do you know how much money
      they've raised here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over three thousand. This town is the greatest town for giving&mdash;give
      to the cholera down South, give to Johnstown, give to Grinnell, give to
      cyclones, give to fires. <i>The Freeman</i> always starts up a
      subscription, and Mr. Bayard runs the thing, and Mr. Lossing always gives.
      Mother, I tell you HE makes them hustle when he takes hold. He's the
      chairman here, and he has township chairmen appointed for every township.
      He's so popular they start in to oblige him, and then, someway, he makes
      them all interested. I must tell you of a funny letter he had to-day from
      a Captain Ferguson, out at Baxter. He's a rich farmer with lots of
      influence and a great worker, Mr. Lossing says. But this is 'most word for
      word what he wrote: 'Dear Sir: I am sorry for the Russians, but my wife is
      down with the la grippe, and I can't get a hired girl; so I have to stay
      with her. If you'll get me a hired girl, I'll get you a lot of money for
      the Russians.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he git a girl? I mean Mr. Lossing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am. He said he'd try if it was the city, but it was easier finding
      gold-mines than girls that would go into the country. See here, I'm
      forgetting your presents. Mother, you look real dragged and&mdash;queer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing; jist a thought kinder struck me 'bout&mdash;'bout that
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly was sorting out the parcels and explaining them; at the end of her
      task her mind harked back to an old grievance. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I've
      been thinking for a long time, and I've made up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearie.&rdquo; Mrs. Louder's eyes grew troubled. She knew something of the
      quality of Tilly's mind, which resembled her father's in a peculiar
      immobility. Once let her decision run into any mould (be it whatsoever it
      might), and let it stiffen, there was no chance, any more than with other
      iron things, of its bending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively I could hardly get up the stairs today,&rdquo; said Tilly&mdash;she
      was putting her jacket and hat away in her orderly fashion; of necessity
      her back was to Mrs. Louder&mdash;&ldquo;there was such a raft of people wanting
      to send stuff and messages to you. You are just working yourself to death;
      and, mother, I am convinced we have <i>got to move!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Louder dropped into a chair and gasped. The baby, who had fallen
      asleep, stirred uneasily. It was not a pretty child; its face was heavy,
      its little cheeks were roughened by the wind, its lower lip sagged, its
      chin creased into the semblance of a fat old man's. But Jane Louder gazed
      down on it with infinite compassion. She stroked its head as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tilly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I've been in this block, Mrs. Carleton and me, ever
      since it was built; and, some way, between us we've managed to keep the
      run of all the folks in it; at least when they were in any trouble. We've
      worked together like sisters. She's 'Piscopal, and I guess I'm Unitarian;
      but never a word between us. We tended the Willardses through diphtheria
      and the Hopkinses through small-pox, and we steamed and fumigated the
      rooms together. It was her first found out the Dillses were letting that
      twelve-year-old child run the gasoline stove, and she threatened to tell
      Mr. Lossing, and they begged off; and when it exploded we put it out
      together, with flour out of her flour-barrel, for the poor, shiftless
      things hadn't half a sack full of their own; and her and me, we took half
      the care of that little neglected Ellis baby that was always sitting down
      in the sticky fly-paper, poor innocent child. He's took the valedictory at
      the High School, Tilly, now. No, Tilly, I couldn't bring myself to leave
      this building, where I've married them, and buried them, and born them,
      you may say, being with so many of their mothers; I feel like they was all
      my children. Don't ASK me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly's head went upward and backward with a little dilatation of the
      nostrils. &ldquo;Now, mother,&rdquo; said she in a voice of determined gentleness,
      &ldquo;just listen to me. Would I ask you to do anything that wouldn't be for
      your happiness? I have found a real pretty house up on Fifteenth Street;
      and we'll keep house together, just as cosey; and have a woman come to
      wash and iron and scrub, so it won't be a bit hard; and be right on the
      street-cars; and you won't have to drudge helping Mrs. Carleton extra
      times with her restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Tilly,&rdquo; eagerly interrupted Mrs. Louder, &ldquo;you know I dearly love to
      cook, and she PAYS me. I couldn't feel right to take any of the pension
      money, or the little property your father left me, away from the house
      expenses; but what I earn myself, it is SUCH a comfort to give away out of
      THAT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly ran over and kissed the agitated face. &ldquo;You dear, generous mother!&rdquo;
       cried she, &ldquo;I'LL give you all the money you want to spend or give. I got
      another rise in my salary of five a month. Don't you worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't thinking of doing anything right away, Tilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it's best done and over with, after we've decided,
      mother? You have worked so hard all your life I want to give you some ease
      and peace now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Tilly, I love to work; I wouldn't be happy to do nothing, and I'd
      get so fleshy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly only laughed. She did not crave the show of authority. Let her but
      have her own way, she would never flaunt her victories. She was imperious,
      but she was not arrogant. For months she had been pondering how to give
      her mother an easier life; and she set the table for supper, in a filial
      glow of satisfaction, never dreaming that her mother, in the kitchen, was
      keeping her head turned from the stove lest she should cry into the fried
      ham and stewed potatoes. But, at a sudden thought, Jane Louder laid her
      big spoon down to wipe her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, Jane Louder&rdquo;&mdash;thus she addressed herself&mdash;&ldquo;mourning
      and grieving to leave your friends and be laid aside for a useless old
      woman, and jist be taken care of, and you clean forgetting the chance the
      Lord gives you to help more'n you ever helped in your life! For shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of exaltation, of lofty resolution, erased the worry lines on her
      face. &ldquo;Why, it might be to save twenty lives,&rdquo; said she; but in the very
      speaking of the words a sharp pain wrenched her heart again, and she
      caught up the baby from the floor, where he sat in a wall of chairs, and
      sobbed over him: &ldquo;Oh, how can I go away when I got to go for good so soon?
      I want every minnit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never thought of disputing Tilly's wishes. &ldquo;It's only fair,&rdquo; said
      Jane. &ldquo;She's lived here all these years to please me, and now I ought to
      be willing to go to please her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither did she for a moment hope to change Tilly's determination. &ldquo;She
      was the settest baby ever was,&rdquo; thought poor Jane, tossing on her pillow,
      in the night watches, &ldquo;and it's grown with every inch of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in the morning she surprised her daughter. &ldquo;Tilly,&rdquo; said she at the
      breakfast-table, &ldquo;Tilly, I got something I must do, and I don't want you
      to oppose me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, ma!&rdquo; said Tilly; &ldquo;as if I ever opposed you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how bad I have been feeling about the poor Russians&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how I've wished and wished I could do something&mdash;something to
      COUNT? I never could, Tilly, because I ain't got the money or the
      intellect; but s'posing I could do it for somebody else, like this Captain
      Ferguson who could do so much if he just could get a hired girl to take
      care of his wife. Well, I do know how to cook and to keep a house neat and
      to do for the sick&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly could restrain herself no longer; her voice rose to a shout of
      dismay&mdash;&ldquo;Mother Louder, you AIN'T thinking of going to be the
      Ferguson's <i>hired girl!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not their hired girl, Tilly; just their help, so as he can work for those
      poor starving creatures.&rdquo; Jane strangled a sob in her throat. Tilly, in a
      kind of stupor of bewilderment, frowned at her plate. Then her clouded
      face cleared. If Mrs. Louder had surprised her daughter, her daughter
      repaid the surprise. &ldquo;Well, if you feel that way, mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I
      won't say a word; and I'll ask Mr. Lossing to explain to the Fergusons and
      fix everything. He will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're real good, Tilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while you're gone I guess it will be a good plan to move and git
      settled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason Tilly's throat felt dry, she lifted her cup. She did not
      intend to look across the table, but her eyes escaped her. She set the
      coffee down untasted. The clock was slow, she muttered; and she left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Louder remained in her place, with the same pale face, staring at the
      table-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't seem like I COULD go, now,&rdquo; she thought dully to herself; &ldquo;the
      time's so awful short, I don't s'pose Maria Carleton can git up to see me
      more'n once or twice a month, busy as she is! I got so to depend on seeing
      her every day. A sister couldn't be kinder! I don't see how I am going to
      bear it. And to go away, beforehand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long while she sat, her face hardly changing. At last, when she did
      push her chair away, her lips were tightly closed. She spoke to the little
      pile of books lying on the table in the corner. &ldquo;I cayn't&mdash;these are
      my own and you are strangers!&rdquo; She walked across the room to take up the
      same magazine which Tilly had found her reading the day before. When she
      began reading she looked stern&mdash;poor Jane, she was steeling her heart&mdash;but
      in a little while she was sniffing and blowing her nose. With a groan she
      flung the book aside. &ldquo;It's no use, I would feel like a murderer if I
      don't go!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did go. Harry Lossing made all the arrangements. Tilly was satisfied.
      But, then, Tilly had not heard Harry's remark to his mother: &ldquo;Alma says
      Miss Louder is trying to make the old lady move against her will. I dare
      say it would be better to give the young woman a chance to miss her mother
      and take a little quiet think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly saw her mother off on the train to Baxter, the Fergusons' station.
      Being a provident, far-sighted, and also inexperienced traveller, she had
      allowed a full half-hour for preliminary passages at arms with the railway
      officials; and, as the train happened to be an hour late, she found
      herself with time to spare, even after she had exhausted the catalogue of
      possible deceptions and catastrophes by rail. During the silence that
      followed her last warning, she sat mentally keeping tally on her fingers.
      &ldquo;Confidence men&rdquo;&mdash;Tilly began with the thumb&mdash;&ldquo;Never give
      anybody her check. Never lend anybody money. Never write her name to
      anything. Don't get out till conductor tells her. In case of accident,
      telegraph me, and keep in the middle of the car, off the trucks. Not take
      care of anybody's baby while she goes off for a minute. Not take care of
      babies at all. Or children. Not talk to strangers&mdash;good gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tilly felt a movement of impatience; there, after all her cautions, there
      was her mother helping an old woman, an utterly strange old woman, to pile
      a bird-cage on a bandbox surmounting a bag. The old woman was clad in a
      black alpaca frock, made with the voluminous draperies of years ago, but
      with the uncreased folds and the brilliant gloss of a new gown. She wore a
      bonnet of a singular shape, unknown to fashion, but made out of good
      velvet. Beneath the bonnet (which was large) appeared a little, round,
      agitated old face, with bobbing white curls and white teeth set a little
      apart in the mouth, a defect that brought a kind of palpitating frankness
      into the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, who HAS mother picked up now?&rdquo; thought Tilly. &ldquo;Well, praise be, she
      hasn't a baby, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the talk between the two; for the old woman being deaf,
      Mrs. Louder elevated her voice, and the old woman, herself, spoke in a
      high, thin pipe that somehow reminded Tilly of a lost lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Louder, &ldquo;a body cayn't help worrying over a
      sick child, especially if they're away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solon and Minnie wouldn't tell me,&rdquo; bleated the other woman, &ldquo;they knew
      I'd worry. Kinder hurt me they should keep things from me; but they hate
      to have me upset. They are awful good children. But I suspicioned
      something when Alonzo kept writing. Minnie, she wouldn't tell me, but I
      pinned her down and it come out, Eliza had the grip bad. And, then,
      nothing would do but I must go to her&mdash;why, Mrs. Louder, she's my
      child! But they wouldn't hark to it. 'Fraid to have me travel alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they take awful good care of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Louder; and she
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, awful.&rdquo; She, too, sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she talked her eyes were darting about the room, eagerly fixed on every
      new arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you expecting anyone, Mrs. Higbee?&rdquo; said Jane. They seemed, at least,
      to know each other by name, thought Tilly; it was amazing the number of
      people mother did know!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Higbee, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;fact is, I'm kinder frightened. I&mdash;fact
      is, Mrs. Louder, I guess I'll tell you, though I don't know you very well;
      but I've known about you so long&mdash;I run away and didn't tell 'em. I
      just couldn't stay way from Liza. And I took the bird&mdash;for the
      children; and it's my bird, and I was 'fraid Minnie would forget to feed
      it and it would be lonesome. My children are awful kind good children, but
      they don't understand. And if Solon sees me he will want me to go back. I
      know I'm dretful foolish; and Solon and Minnie will make me see I am.
      There won't be no good reason for me to go, and I'll have to stay; and I
      feel as if I should FLY&mdash;Oh, massy sakes! there's Solon coming down
      the street&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran a few steps in half a dozen ways, then fluttered back to her bag
      and her cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Louder, drawing herself up to her full height, &ldquo;you
      SHALL go if you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solon will find me, he'll know the bird-cage! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a most unexpected helper stepped upon the stage. What is the
      mysterious instinct of rebellion to authority that, nine cases out of ten,
      sends us to the aid of a fugitive? Tilly, the unconscious despot of her
      own mother, promptly aided and abetted Solon's rebel mother in her flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if <i>I</i> carry it,&rdquo; said she, snatching up the bird-cage; &ldquo;run
      inside that den where they sell refreshments; he'll see ME and go
      somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It fell out precisely as she planned. They heard Solon demanding a lady
      with a bird-cage of the agent; they heard the agent's reply, given with
      official indifference, &ldquo;There she is, inside.&rdquo; Directly, Solon, a small
      man with an anxious mien, ran into the waiting-room, flung a glance of
      disappointment at Tilly, and ran out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilly went to her client. &ldquo;Did he look like he was anxious?&rdquo; was the
      mother's greeting. &ldquo;Oh, I just know he and Minnie will be hunting me
      everywhere. Maybe I had better go home, 'stead of to Baxter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you hadn't,&rdquo; said Tilly, with decision. &ldquo;Mother's going to Baxter,
      too, and if you like, minnit you're safely off, I'll go tell your folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're real kind, I'd be ever so much obliged. And you don't mind your ma
      travelling alone? ain't that nice for her!&rdquo; She seemed much cheered by the
      prospect of company and warmed into confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am kinder lonesome, sometimes, that's a fact,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I kinder
      wish I lived in a block or a flat like your ma. You see, Minnie teaches in
      the public school and she's away all day, and she don't like to have me
      make company of the hired girl, though she's a real nice girl. And there
      ain't nothing for me to do, and I feel like I wasn't no use any more in
      the world. I remember that's what our old minister in Ohio said once. He
      was a real nice old man; and they HAD thought everything of him in the
      parish; but he got old and his sermons were long; and so they got a young
      man for assistant; and they made HIM a <i>pastor americus</i>, they called
      it&mdash;some sort of Latin. Folks did say the young feller was stuck up
      and snubbed the old man; anyhow, he never preached after young Lisbon
      come; and only made the first prayers. But when the old folks would ask
      him to preach some of the old sermons they had liked, he only would say,
      'No, friends, I know more about my sermons, now.' He didn't live very
      long, and I always kinder fancied being a AMERICUS killed him. And some
      days I git to feeling like I was a kinder AMERICUS myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain't fair to your children,&rdquo; said Tilly; &ldquo;you ought to let them
      know how you feel. Then they'd act different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know, I don't know. You see, miss, they're so sure they know
      better'n me. Say, Mrs. Louder, be you going to visit relatives in Baxter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am, I'm going to take care of a sick lady,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;it's
      kinder queer. Her name's Ferguson, her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land's sake!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Higbee, &ldquo;why, that's my 'Liza!&rdquo; She
      was in a flutter of surprise and delight, and so absorbed was Tilly in
      getting her and her unwieldy luggage into the car, that Jane's daughter
      forgot to kiss her mother good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your arm in QUICK,&rdquo; she yelled, as Jane essayed to kiss her hand
      through the window; &ldquo;don't EVER put your arm or your head out of a train!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      train moved away&mdash;&ldquo;I do hope she'll remember what I told her, and not
      lend anybody money, or come home lugging somebody else's baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such reflections, and an ugly sensation of loneliness creeping over
      her, Tilly went to assure Miss Minnie Higbee of her mother's safety. She
      described her reception to Harry Lossing and Alma, later. &ldquo;She really
      seemed kinder mad at me,&rdquo; says Tilly, &ldquo;seemed to think I was interfering
      somehow. And she hadn't any business to feel that way, for SHE didn't know
      how I'd fooled her brother with that bird-cage. I guess the poor old lady
      daren't call her soul her own. I'd hate to have my mother that way&mdash;so
      'fraid of me. MY mother shall go where she pleases, and stay where she
      pleases, and DO as she pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me think,&rdquo; says Alma, &ldquo;I heard you were going to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are. Mother is working too hard. She knows everybody in the
      building, and they call on her all the time; and I think the easiest way
      out is just to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alma and Mr. Lossing exchanged glances. There is an Arabian legend of an
      angel whose trade it is to decipher the language of faces. This angel must
      have perceived that Alma's eyes said, with the courage of a second in a
      duel, &ldquo;Go on, now is the time!&rdquo; and that Harry's answered, with masculine
      pusillanimity, &ldquo;I don't like to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he spoke. &ldquo;Very likely your mother does sometimes work too hard,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;But don't you think it would be harder for her not to work? Why, she
      must have been in the building ever since my father bought it; and she's
      been a janitor and a fire inspector and a doctor and a ministering angel
      combined! That is why we never raised the rent to you when we improved the
      building, and raised it on the others. My father told me your mother was
      the best paying tenant he ever had. And don't you remember how, when I
      used to come with him, when I was a little boy, she used to take me in her
      room while he went the rounds? She was always doing good to everybody, the
      same way. She has a heart as big as the Mississippi, and I assure you,
      Miss Louder, you won't make her happy, but miserable, if you try to dam up
      its channel. She has often told me that she loved the building and all the
      people in it. They all love her. I HOPE, Miss Louder, you'll think of
      those things before you decide. She is so unselfish that she would go in a
      minute if she thought it would make you happier.&rdquo; The angel aforesaid,
      during this speech (which Harry delivered with great energy and feeling),
      must have had all his wits busy on Tilly's impassive features; but he
      could read ardent approval, succeeded by indignation, on Alma's
      countenance, at his first glance. The indignation came when Tilly spoke.
      She said: &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Lossing, you're very kind, I'm sure&rdquo;&mdash;Harry
      softly kicked the wastebasket under the desk&mdash;&ldquo;but I guess it's best
      for us to go. I've been thinking about it for six months, and I know it
      will be a hard struggle for mother to go; but in a little while she will
      be glad she went. It's only for her sake I am doing it; it ain't an easy
      or a pleasant thing for me to do, either&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; As Tilly stopped
      her voice was unsteady, and the rare tears shone in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's best for her is the only question, of course,&rdquo; said Alma, helping
      Harry off the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days Tilly received a long letter from her mother. Mr. Ferguson
      was doing wonders for the Russians; the family were all very kind to her
      and &ldquo;nice folks&rdquo; and easily pleased. (&ldquo;Of COURSE they're pleased with
      mother's cooking; what would they be made of if they weren't!&rdquo; cried
      Tilly.) It was wonderful how much help Mrs. Higbee was about the house,
      and how happy it made her. Mrs. Ferguson had seemed real glad to see her,
      and that made her happy. And then, maybe it helped a little, her (Jane
      Louder's) telling Mrs. Ferguson (&ldquo;accidental like&rdquo;) how Tilly treated her,
      never trying to boss her, and letting her travel alone. Perhaps, if Mrs.
      Ferguson kept on improving, they might let her come home next week. And
      the letter ended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be so glad if they do, for I want to see you so bad, dear
      daughter, and I want to see the old home once more before we leave. I
      guess the house you tell me about will be very nice and convenient. I do
      thank you, dear daughter, for being so nice and considerate about the
      Russians. Give my love to Mrs. Carleton and all of them; and if little
      Bobby Green hasn't missed school since I left, give him a nickel, please;
      and please give that medical student on the fifth floor&mdash;I forget his
      name&mdash;the stockings I mended. They are in the first drawer of the
      walnut bureau. Good-by, my dear, good daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MOTHER, JANE M. LOUDER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Tilly read the letter she was surrounded by wall-paper and carpet
      samples. Her eyes grew moist before she laid it down; but she set her
      mouth more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an awful short time, but I've just got to hurry and have it over
      before she comes,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next week Jane returned. She was on the train, waiting in her seat in the
      car, when Captain Ferguson handed her Tilly's last letter, which had lain
      in the post-office for three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very short:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MOTHER: I shall be very glad indeed to see you. I have a surprise
      which I hope will be pleasant for you; anyhow, I truly have meant it for
      your happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate daughter,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. E. LOUDER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There must have been, despite her shrewd sense, an obtuse streak in Tilly,
      else she would never have written that letter. Jane read it twice. The
      paper rattled in her hands. &ldquo;Tilly has moved while I was gone,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;I never shall live in the block again.&rdquo; She dropped her veil over her
      face. She sat very quietly in her seat; but the conductor who came for her
      ticket watched her sharply, she seemed so dazed by his demand and was so
      long in finding the ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train rumbled and hissed through darkening cornfields, into scattered
      yellow lights of low houses, into angles of white light of street-arcs and
      shop-windows, into the red and blue lights dancing before the engines in
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Tilly's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane let her and Harry Lossing take all her bundles and lift her out of
      the car. Whether she spoke a word she could not tell. She did rouse a
      little at the vision of the Lossing carriage glittering at the street
      corner; but she had not the sense to thank Harry Lossing, who placed her
      in the carriage and lifted his hat in farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he doing all that for, Tilly?&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;there ain't&mdash;there
      ain't nobody dead&mdash;Maria Carleton&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stared at
      Tilly wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilly was oddly moved, though she tried to speak lightly. &ldquo;No, no, there
      ain't nothing wrong, at all. It's because you've done so much for the
      Russians&mdash;and other folks! Now, ma, I'm going to be mysterious. You
      must shut your eyes and shut your mouth until I tell you. That's a dear
      ma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was vaguely comforting to have Tilly so affectionate. &ldquo;I'm a wicked,
      ungrateful woman to be so wretched,&rdquo; thought Jane; &ldquo;I'll never let Tilly
      know how I felt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a surprisingly short time the carriage stopped. &ldquo;Now, ma,&rdquo; said Tilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great blaze of light seemed all about Jane Louder. There were the dear
      familiar windows of the Lossing block.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up-stairs, ma,&rdquo; said Tilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed like one in a dream; and like one in a dream she was pushed
      into her own old parlor. The old parlor, but not quite the old parlor;
      hung with new wall-paper, shining with new paint, soft under her feet with
      a new carpet, it looked to Jane Louder like fairyland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tilly,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;oh, Tilly, ain't you moved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor we ain't going to move, ma&mdash;that's the surprise! I took the
      money I'd saved for moving, for the new carpet and new dishes; and the
      Lossings they papered and painted. I was SO 'fraid we couldn't get done in
      time. Alma and all the boarders are coming in pretty soon to welcome you,
      and they've all chipped in for a little banquet at Mrs. Carleton's&mdash;why,
      mother, you're crying! Mother, you didn't really think I'd move when it
      made you feel so bad? I know I'm set and stubborn, and I didn't take it
      well when Mr. Lossing talked to me; but the more I thought it over, the
      more I seemed to myself like that hateful Minnie. Oh, mother, I ain't, am
      I? You shall do just exactly as you like all the days of your life!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AN ASSISTED PROVIDENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was the Christmas turkeys that should be held responsible. Every year
      the Lossings give each head of a family in their employ, and each lad
      helping to support his mother, a turkey at Christmastide. As the business
      has grown, so has the number of turkeys, until it is now well up in the
      hundreds, and requires a special contract. Harry, one Christmas, some two
      years ago, bought the turkeys at so good a bargain that he felt the
      natural reaction in an impulse to extravagance. In the very flood-tide of
      the money-spending yearnings, he chanced to pass Deacon Hurst's stables
      and to see two Saint Bernard puppies, of elephantine size but of the
      tenderest age, gambolling on the sidewalk before the office. Deacon Hurst,
      I should explain, is no more a deacon than I am; he is a livery-stable
      keeper, very honest, a keen and solemn sportsman, and withal of a staid
      demeanor and a habitual garb of black. Now you know as well as I any
      reason for his nickname.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deacon Hurst is fond of the dog as well as of that noble animal the horse
      (he has three copies of &ldquo;Black Beauty&rdquo; in his stable, which would do an
      incalculable amount of good if they were ever read!); and he usually has
      half a dozen dogs of his own, with pedigrees long enough for a poor
      gentlewoman in a New England village. He told Harry that the Saint
      Bernards were grandsons of Sir Bevidere, the &ldquo;finest dog of his time in
      the world, sir;&rdquo; that they were perfectly marked and very large for their
      age (which Harry found it easy to believe of the young giants), and that
      they were &ldquo;ridiculous, sir, at the figger of two hundred and fifty!&rdquo;
       (which Harry did not believe so readily); and, after Harry had admired and
      studied the dogs for the space of half an hour, he dropped the price, in a
      kind of spasm of generosity, to two hundred dollars. Harry was tempted to
      close the bargain on the spot, hot-headed, but he decided to wait and
      prepare his mother for such a large addition to the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he dwelt on the subject the more he longed to buy the dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a time comes to every healthy man when he wants a dog, just as a
      time comes when he wants a wife; and Harry's dog was dead. By consequence,
      Harry was in the state of sensitive affection and desolation to which a
      promising new object makes the most moving appeal. The departed dog (Bruce
      by name) had been a Saint Bernard; and Deacon Hurst found one of the
      puppies to have so much the expression of countenance of the late Bruce
      that he named him Bruce on the spot&mdash;a little before Harry joined the
      group. Harry did not at first recognize this resemblance, but he grew to
      see it; and, combined with the dog's affectionate disposition, it softened
      his heart. By the time he told his mother he was come to quoting Hurst's
      adjectives as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauties, mother,&rdquo; says Harry, with sparkling eyes; &ldquo;the markings are
      perfect&mdash;couldn't be better; and their heads are shaped just right!
      You can't get such watch-dogs in the world! And, for all their enormous
      strength, gentle as a lamb to women and children! And, mother, one of them
      looks like Bruce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they would want to be housedogs,&rdquo; says Mrs. Lossing, a little
      dubiously, but looking fondly at Harry's handsome face; &ldquo;you know,
      somehow, all our dogs, no matter how properly they start in a kennel, end
      by being so hurt if we keep them there that they come into the house. And
      they are so large, it is like having a pet lion about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These dogs, mother, shall never put a paw in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope just as I get fond of them they will not have the distemper
      and die!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lossing; which speech Harry rightly took for the white
      flag of surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening he went to find Hurst and clinch the bargain. As it happened,
      Hurst was away, driving an especially important political personage to an
      especially important political council. The day following was a Sunday;
      but, by this time, Harry was so bent upon obtaining the dogs that he had
      it in mind to go to Hurst's house for them in the afternoon. When Harry
      wants anything, from Saint Bernards to purity in politics, he wants it
      with an irresistible impetus! If he did wrong, his error was linked to its
      own punishment. But this is anticipating, if not presuming; I prefer to
      leave Harry Lossing's experience to paint its own moral without pushing.
      The event that happened next was Harry's pulling out his check-book and
      beginning to write a check, remarking, with a slight drooping of his
      eyelids, &ldquo;Best catch the deacon's generosity on the fly, or it may make a
      home run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he let the pen fall on the blotter, for he had remembered the day.
      After an instant's hesitation he took a couple of hundred-dollar
      bank-notes out of a drawer (I think they were gifts for his two sisters on
      Christmas day, for he is a generous brother; and most likely there would
      be some small domestic joke about engravings to go with them); these he
      placed in the right-hand pocket of his waistcoat. In his left-hand
      waistcoat pocket were two five-dollar notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was now arrayed for church. He was a figure to please any woman's
      eye, thought his mother, as she walked beside him, and gloried silently in
      his six feet of health and muscle and dainty cleanliness. He was in a most
      amiable mood, what with the Saint Bernards and the season. As they
      approached the cathedral close, Harry, not for the first time, admired the
      pure Gothic lines of the cathedral, and the soft blending of grays in the
      stone with the warmer hues of the brown network of Virginia creeper that
      still fluttered, a remnant of the crimson adornings of autumn. Beyond were
      the bare, square outlines of the old college, with a wooden cupola perched
      on the roof, like a little hat on a fat man, the dull-red tints of the
      professors' houses, and the withered lawns and bare trees. The turrets and
      balconies and arched windows of the boys' school displayed a red
      background for a troop of gray uniforms and blazing buttons; the boys were
      forming to march to church. Opposite the boys' school stood the modest
      square brick house that had served the first bishop of the diocese during
      laborious years. Now it was the dean's residence. Facing it, just as you
      approached the cathedral, the street curved into a half-circle on either
      side, and in the centre the granite soldier on his shaft looked over the
      city that would honor him. Harry saw the tall figure of the dean come out
      of his gate, the long black skirts of his cassock fluttering under the
      wind of his big steps. Beside him skipped and ran, to keep step with him,
      a little man in ill-fitting black, of whose appearance, thus viewed from
      the rear, one could only observe stooping shoulders and iron-gray hair
      that curled at the ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be the poor missionary who built his church himself,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Lossing observed; &ldquo;he is not much of a preacher, the dean said, but he is
      a great worker and a good pastor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for his people, and the worse for us!&rdquo; says Harry,
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. We shall get the poor sermon and they will get the good
      pastoring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Harry caught sight of a woman's frock and a profile that he knew, and
      thought no more of the preacher, whoever he might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was in the chancel in plain view, after the procession of
      choir-boys had taken their seats. He was an elderly man with thin cheeks
      and a large nose. He had one of those great, orotund voices that
      occasionally roll out of little men, and he read the service with a
      misjudged effort to fill the building. The building happened to have
      peculiarly fine acoustic properties; but the unfortunate man roared like
      him of Bashan. There was nothing of the customary ecclesiastical dignity
      and monotony about his articulation; indeed, it grew plain and plainer to
      Harry that he must have &ldquo;come over&rdquo; from some franker and more emotional
      denomination. It seemed quite out of keeping with his homely manner and
      crumpled surplice that this particular reader should intone. Intone,
      nevertheless, he did; and as badly as mortal man well could! It was not so
      much that his voice or his ear went wrong; he would have had a musical
      voice of the heavy sort, had he not bellowed; neither did his ear betray
      him; the trouble seemed to be that he could not decide when to begin; now
      he began too early, and again, with a startled air, he began too late, as
      if he had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will not preach,&rdquo; thought Harry, who was absorbed in a rapt
      contemplation of his sweetheart's back hair. He came back from a tender
      revery (by way of a little detour into the furniture business and the
      establishment that a man of his income could afford) to the church and the
      preacher and his own sins, to find the strange clergyman in the pulpit,
      plainly frightened, and bawling more loudly than ever under the influence
      of fear. He preached a sermon of wearisome platitudes; making up for lack
      of thought by repetition, and shouting himself red in the face to express
      earnestness. &ldquo;Fourth-class Methodist effort,&rdquo; thought the listener in the
      Lossing pew, stroking his fair mustache, &ldquo;with Episcopal decorations! That
      man used to be a Methodist minister, and he was brought into the fold by a
      high-churchman. Poor fellow, the Methodist church polity has a place for
      such fellows as he; but he is a stray sheep with us. He doesn't half catch
      on to the motions; yet I'll warrant he is proud of that sermon, and his
      wife thinks it one of the great efforts of the century.&rdquo; Here Harry took a
      short rest from the sermon, to contemplate the amazing moral phenomenon:
      how robust can be a wife's faith in a commonplace husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, this man,&rdquo; reflected Harry, growing interested in his own fancies,
      &ldquo;this man never can have LIVED! He doesn't know what it is to suffer, he
      has only vegetated! Doubtless, in a prosaic way, he loves his wife and
      children; but can a fellow who talks like him have any delicate sympathies
      or any romance about him? He looks honest; I think he is a right good
      fellow and works like a soldier; but to be so stupid as he is, ought to
      HURT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry felt a whimsical moving of sympathy towards the preacher. He
      wondered why he continually made gestures with the left arm, never with
      his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives a one-sided effect to his eloquence,&rdquo; said he. But he thought
      that he understood when an unguarded movement revealed a rent which had
      been a mended place in the surplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; said Harry. He recalled how, as a boy, he had gone to a
      fancy-dress ball in Continental smallclothes, so small that he had been
      strictly cautioned by his mother and sisters not to bow except with the
      greatest care, lest he rend his magnificence and reveal that it was too
      tight to allow an inch of underclothing. The stockings, in particular, had
      been short, and his sister had providently sewed them on to the
      knee-breeches, and to guard against accidents still further, had pinned as
      well as sewed, the pins causing Harry much anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Harry again, &ldquo;I wonder is HE pinned somewhere? I feel
      like giving him a lift; he is so prosy it isn't likely anyone else will
      feel moved to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came about that when the dean announced that the alms this day
      would be given to the parish of our friend who had just addressed us; and
      the plate paused before the Lossing pew, Harry slipped his hand into his
      waistcoat pocket after those two five-dollar notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should explain that Harry being a naturally left-handed boy, who has
      laboriously taught himself the use of his right hand, it is a family joke
      that he is like the inhabitants of Nineveh, who could not tell their right
      hand from their left. But Harry himself has always maintained that he can
      tell as well as the next man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out drifted the flock of choir-boys singing, &ldquo;For thee, oh dear, dear
      country,&rdquo; and presently, following them, out drifted the congregation;
      among the crowd the girl that Harry loved, not so quickly that he had not
      time for a look and a smile (just tinged with rose); and because she was
      so sweet, so good, so altogether adorable, and because she had not only
      smiled but blushed, and, unobserved, he had touched the fur of her jacket,
      the young man walked on air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not remember the Saint Bernards until after the early Sunday
      dinner, and during the after-dinner cigar. He was sitting in the library,
      before some blazing logs, at peace with all the world. To him, thus, came
      his mother and announced that the dean and &ldquo;that man who preached this
      morning, you know,&rdquo; were waiting in the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem excited,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and talk about your munificence. What HAVE
      you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appear to make a great deal of fuss over ten dollars,&rdquo; said Harry,
      lightly, as he sauntered out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dean greeted him with something almost like confusion in his
      cordiality; he introduced his companion as the Rev. Mr. Gilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gilling could not feel easy until he had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made sure about there being no mistake,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Gilling; &ldquo;I&mdash;the
      sum was so great&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ghastly suspicion shot like a fever-flush over Harry's mind. Could it be
      possible? There were the two other bills; could he have given one of them?
      Given that howling dervish a hundred dollars? The thought was too awful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was really not enough for you to trouble yourself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I dare
      say you are thanking the wrong man.&rdquo; He felt he must say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise the dean colored, while the other clergyman answered, in
      all simplicity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no, sir. I know very well. The only other bill, except dollars,
      on the plate, the dean here gave, and the warden remembers that you put in
      two notes&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;he grew quite pale&mdash;&ldquo;I can't help thinking
      you maybe intended to put in only ONE!&rdquo; His voice broke, he tried to
      control it. &ldquo;The sum is so VERY large!&rdquo; quavered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given him BOTH bills, two hundred dollars!&rdquo; thought Harry. He sat
      down. He was accustomed to read men's faces, and plainly as ever he had
      read, he could read the signs of distress and conflict on the prosaic,
      dull features before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I INTENDED to put in two bills,&rdquo; said he. Gilling gave a little gasp&mdash;so
      little, only a quick ear could have caught it; but Harry's ear is quick.
      He twisted one leg around the other, a further sign of deliverance of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, well, Mr. Lossing,&rdquo; he remarked, clearing his throat, &ldquo;I
      cannot express to you properly the&mdash;the appreciation I have of your&mdash;your
      PRINCELY gift!&rdquo; (Harry changed a groan into a cough and tried to smile.)
      &ldquo;I would like to ask you, however, HOW you would like it to be divided.
      There are a number of worthy causes: the furnishing of the church, which
      is in charge of the Ladies' Aid Society; they are very hard workers, the
      ladies of our church. And there is the Altar Guild, which has the keeping
      of the altar in order. They are mostly young girls, and they used to wash
      my things&mdash;I mean the vestments&rdquo; (blushing)&mdash;&ldquo;but they&mdash;they
      were so young they were not careful, and my wife thought she had best wash
      the&mdash;vestments herself, but she allowed them to laundry the other&mdash;ah,
      things.&rdquo; There was the same discursiveness in his talk as in his sermon,
      Harry thought; and the same uneasy restlessness of manner. &ldquo;Then, we give
      to&mdash;various causes, and&mdash;and there is, also, my own salary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what it was intended for,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;I hope the two hundred
      dollars will be of some use to you, and then, indirectly, it will help
      your church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry surprised a queer glance from the dean's brown eyes; there was both
      humor and a something else that was solemn enough in it. The dean had
      believed that there was a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of it! To ME!&rdquo; cried Gilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of it. To YOU,&rdquo; Harry replied, dryly. He was conscious of the dean's
      gaze upon him. &ldquo;I had a sudden impulse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I gave it; that is
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears rose to the clergyman's eyes; he tried to wink them away, then
      he tried to brush them away with a quick rub of his fingers, then he
      sprang up and walked to the window, his back to Harry. Directly he was
      facing the young man again, and speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, Mr. Lossing; since my sickness a little thing upsets
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gilling had diphtheria last spring,&rdquo; the dean struck in, &ldquo;there was
      an epidemic of diphtheria, in Matin's Junction; Mr. Gilling really saved
      the place; but his wife and he both contracted the disease, and his wife
      nearly died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry remembered some story that he had heard at the time&mdash;his eyes
      began to light up as they do when he is moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, YOU are the man that made them disinfect their houses,&rdquo; cried he,
      &ldquo;and invented a little oven or something to steam mattresses and things.
      You are the man that nursed them and buried them when the undertaker died.
      You digged graves with your own hands&mdash;I say, I should like to shake
      hands with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilling shook hands, submissively, but looking bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Would you mind, Mr. Lossing, if I took up your
      time so far as to tell you what so overcame me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, my wife was the daughter of the Episcopal minister&mdash;I
      mean the rector, at the town&mdash;well, it wasn't a town, it was two or
      three towns off in Shelby County where I had my circuit. You may be
      surprised, sir, to know that I was once a Methodist minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Her father&mdash;my wife's, I mean&mdash;was about as high a
      churchman as he could be, and be married. He induced me to join our
      communion; and very soon after I was married. I hope, Mr. Lossing, you'll
      come and see us some time, and see my wife. She&mdash;are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good wife cometh from the Lord, sir, SURE! I thought I appreciated
      mine, but I guess I didn't. She had two things she wanted, and one I did
      want myself; but the other&mdash;I couldn't seem to bring my mind to it,
      no&mdash;anyhow! We hadn't any children but one that died four years ago,
      a little baby. Ever since she died my wife has had a longing to have a
      stained-glass window, with the picture, you know, of Christ blessing
      little children, put into our little church. In Memoriam, you know. Seems
      as if, now we've lost the baby, we think all the more of the church. Maybe
      she was a sort of idol to us. Yes, sir, that's one thing my wife fairly
      longed for. We've saved our money, what we COULD save; there are so many
      calls; during the sickness, last winter, the sick needed so many things,
      and it didn't seem right for us to neglect them just for our baby's
      window; and&mdash;the money went. The other thing was different. My wife
      has got it into her head I have a fine voice. And she's higher church than
      I am; so she has always wanted me to INTONE. I told her I'd look like a
      fool intoning, and there's no mistake about it, I DO! But she couldn't see
      it that way. It was 'most the only point wherein we differed; and last
      spring, when she was so sick, and I didn't know but I'd lose her, it was
      dreadful to me to think how I'd crossed her. So, Mr. Lossing, when she got
      well I promised her, for a thank-offering, I'd intone. And I have ever
      since. My people know me so well, and we've been through so much together,
      that they didn't make any fuss&mdash;though they are not high&mdash;fact
      is, I'm not high myself. But they were kind and considerate, and I got on
      pretty well at home; but when I came to rise up in that great edifice,
      before that cultured and intellectual audience, so finely dressed, it did
      seem to me I could NOT do it! I was sorely tempted to break my promise. I
      was, for a fact.&rdquo; He drew a long breath. &ldquo;I just had to pray for grace, or
      I never would have pulled through. I had the sermon my wife likes best
      with me; but I know it lacks&mdash;it lacks&mdash;it isn't what you need!
      I was dreadfully scared and I felt miserable when I got up to preach it&mdash;and
      then to think that you were&mdash;but it is the Lord's doing and
      marvellous in our eyes! I don't know what Maggie will say when I tell her
      we can get the window. The best she hoped was I'd bring back enough so the
      church could pay me eighteen dollars they owe on my salary. And now&mdash;it's
      wonderful! Why, Mr. Lossing, I've been thinking so much and wanting so to
      get that window for her, that, hearing the dean wanted some car-pentering
      done, I thought maybe, as I'm a fair carpenter&mdash;that was my trade
      once, sir&mdash;I'd ask him to let ME do the job. I was aware there is
      nothing in our rules&mdash;I mean our canons&mdash;to prevent me, and
      nobody need know I was the rector of Matin's Junction, because I would
      come just in my overalls. There is a cheap place where I could lodge, and
      I could feed myself for almost nothing, living is so cheap. I was praying
      about that, too. Now, your noble generosity will enable me to donate what
      they owe on my salary, and get the window too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;donate nothing. Say nothing about this
      gift; I will take care of the warden, and I can answer for the dean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;on the whole, Gilling, you would better say
      nothing, I think; Mr. Lossing is more afraid of a reputation for
      generosity than of the small-pox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man looked at Harry with glistening eyes of admiration; with
      what Christian virtues of humility he was endowing that embarrassed young
      man, it is painful to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dean's eyes twinkled above his handkerchief, which hid his mouth, as
      he rose to make his farewells. He shook hands, warmly. &ldquo;God bless you,
      Harry,&rdquo; said he. Gilling, too, wrung Harry's hands; he was seeking some
      parting word of gratitude, but he could only choke out, &ldquo;I hope you will
      get MARRIED some time, Mr. Lossing, then you'll understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harry, as the door closed, and he flung out his arms and his
      chest in a huge sigh, &ldquo;I do believe it was better than the puppies!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      HARRY LOSSING
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE note-book of Mr. Horatio Armorer, president of our street railways,
      contained a page of interest to some people in our town, on the occasion
      of his last visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote it while the train creaked over the river, and the porter of his
      Pullman car was brushing all the dust that had been distributed on the
      passengers' clothing, into the main aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you had seen him writing it (with a stubby little pencil that he
      occasionally brightened with the tip of his tongue), you would not have
      dreamed him to be more profoundly disturbed than he had been in years. Nor
      would the page itself have much enlightened you.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;<i>See abt road M&mdash; D&mdash;        See L
        See E &amp; M tea-set
        See abt L</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Translated into long-hand, this reads: &ldquo;See about the street-car road,
      Marston (the superintendent) and Dane (the lawyer). See Lossing, see
      Esther and Maggie, and remember about tea-set. See about Lossing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His memoranda written, he slipped the book in his pocket, reflecting
      cynically, &ldquo;There's habit! I've no need of writing that. It's not pleasant
      enough to forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirty odd years ago, Horatio Armorer&mdash;they called him 'Raish, then&mdash;had
      left the town to seek his fortune in Chicago. It was his daydream to
      wrestle a hundred thousand dollars out of the world's tight fists, and
      return to live in pomp on Brady Street hill! He should drive a buggy with
      two horses, and his wife should keep two girls. Long ago, the hundred
      thousand limit had been reached and passed, next the million; and still he
      did not return. His father, the Presbyterian minister, left his parish,
      or, to be exact, was gently propelled out of his parish by the
      disaffected; the family had a new home; and the son, struggling to help
      them out of his scanty resources, went to the new parish and not to the
      old. He grew rich, he established his brothers and sisters in prosperity,
      he erected costly monuments and a memorial church to his parents (they
      were beyond any other gifts from him); he married, and lavished his money
      on three daughters; but the home of his youth neither saw him nor his
      money until Margaret Ellis bought a house on Brady Street, far up town,
      where she could have all the grass that she wanted. Mrs. Ellis was a widow
      and rich. Not a millionaire like her brother, but the possessor of a
      handsome property.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the best-natured woman in the world, and never guessed how hard
      her neighbors found it to forgive her for always calling their town of
      thirty thousand souls, &ldquo;the country.&rdquo; She said that she had pined for
      years to live in the country, and have horses, and a Jersey cow and
      chickens, and &ldquo;a neat pig.&rdquo; All of which modest cravings she gratified on
      her little estate; and the gardener was often seen with a scowl and the
      garden hose, keeping the pig neat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was later that Mr. Armorer had bought the street railways, they having
      had a troublous history and being for sale cheap. Nobody that knows
      Armorer as a business man would back his sentiment by so much as an old
      shoe; yet it was sentiment, and not a good bargain, that had enticed the
      financier. Once engaged, the instincts of a shrewd trader prompted him to
      turn it into a good bargain, anyhow. His fancy was pleased by a vision of
      a return to the home of his childhood and his struggling youth, as a
      greater personage than his hopes had ever dared promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the event, there was little enough gratification for his vanity.
      Not since his wife's death had he been so harassed and anxious; for he
      came not in order to view his new property, but because his sister had
      written him her suspicions that Harry Lossing wanted to marry his youngest
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armorer arrived in the early dawn. Early as it was, a handsome victoria,
      with horses sleeker of skin and harness heavier and brighter than one is
      used to meet outside the great cities, had been in waiting for twenty
      minutes; while for that space of time a pretty girl had paced up and down
      the platform. The keenest observer among the crowd, airing its meek
      impatience on the platform, did not detect any sign of anxiety in her
      behavior. She walked erect, with a step that left a clean-cut footprint in
      the dust, as girls are trained to walk nowadays. Her tailor-made gown of
      fine blue serge had not a wrinkle. It was so simple that only a
      fashionable woman could guess anywhere near the awful sum total which that
      plain skirt, that short jacket, and that severe waistcoat had once made on
      a ruled sheet of paper. When she turned her face toward the low, red
      station-house and the people, it looked gentle, and the least in the world
      sad. She had one of those clear olive skins that easily grow pale; it was
      pale to-day. Her black hair was fine as spun silk; the coil under her
      hat-brim shone as she moved. The fine hair, the soft, transparent skin,
      and the beautiful marking of her brows were responsible for an air of
      fragile daintiness in her person, just as her almond-shaped, liquid dark
      eyes and unsmiling mouth made her look sad. It was a most attractive face,
      in all its moods; sometimes it was a beautiful face; yet it did not have a
      single perfect feature except the mouth, which&mdash;at least so Harry
      Lossing told his mother&mdash;might have been stolen from the Venus of
      Milo. Even the mouth, some critics called too small for her nose; but it
      is as easy to call her nose too large for her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she turned her back on the bustle of the station, all the
      lines in her face seemed to waver and the eyes to brighten. Finally, when
      the train rolled up to the platform and a young-looking elderly man swung
      himself nimbly off the steps, the color flared up in her cheeks, only to
      sink as suddenly; like a candle flame in a gust of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Armorer put his two arms and his umbrella and travelling-bag about the
      charming shape in blue, at the same time exclaiming, &ldquo;You're a good girl
      to come out so early, Essie! How's Aunt Meg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. She would have come too, but she hasn't come back from
      training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Training?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, she has a regular trainer, like John L. Sullivan, you know.
      She drives out to the park with Eliza and me, and walks and runs races,
      and does gymnastics. She has lost ten pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer wagged his head with a grin: &ldquo;I dare say. I thought so when you
      began. Meg is always moaning and groaning because she isn't a sylph! She
      will make her cook's life a burden for about two months and lose ten
      pounds, and then she will revel in ice-cream! Last time, she was raving
      about Dr. Salisbury and living on beefsteak sausages, spending a fortune
      starving herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had Dr. Salisbury's pamphlet; but Cardigan told her it was a long way
      out; so she said she hated to have it do no one any good, and she gave it
      to Maria, one of the maids, who is always fretting because she is so
      thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the thing was to cure fat people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; Esther laughed a little low laugh, at which her father's eyes
      shone; &ldquo;but you see she told Maria to exactly reverse the advice and eat
      everything that was injurious to stout people, and it would be just right
      for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; said Armorer, dryly; &ldquo;very ingenious and feminine scheme.
      But who is Cardigan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shuey Cardigan? He is the trainer. He is a fireman in a furniture shop,
      now; but he used to be the boxing teacher for some Harvard men; and he was
      a distinguished pugilist, once. He said to me, modestly, 'I don't suppose
      you will have seen my name in the <i>Police Gazette</i>, miss?' But he
      really is a very sober, decent man, notwithstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Meg always was picking up queer birds! Pray, who introduced
      this decent pugilist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Esther was getting into the carriage; her face was turned from him, but he
      could see the pink deepen in her ear and the oval of her cheek. She
      answered that it was a friend of theirs, Mr. Lossing. As if the name had
      struck them both dumb, neither spoke for a few moments. Armorer bit a sigh
      in two. &ldquo;Essie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I guess it is no use to side-track the subject.
      You know why I came here, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Meg told me what she wrote to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she would. She had compunctions of conscience letting him hang
      round you, until she told me; and then she had awful gripes because she
      had told, and had to confess to YOU!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued in a different tone: &ldquo;Essie, I have missed your mother a long
      while, and nobody knows how that kind of missing hurts; but it seems to me
      I never missed her as I do to-day. I need her to advise me about you,
      Essie. It is like this: I don't want to be a stern parent any more than
      you want to elope on a rope ladder. We have got to look at this thing
      together, my dear little girl, and try to&mdash;to trust each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think, papa,&rdquo; said Esther, smiling rather tremulously, &ldquo;that we
      would better wait, before we have all these solemn preparations, until we
      know surely whether Mr. Lossing wants me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never said anything of&mdash;of that&mdash;kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is in love with you fast enough,&rdquo; growled Armorer; but a smile of
      intense relief brightened his face. &ldquo;Now, you see, my dear, all I know
      about this young man, except that he wants my daughter&mdash;which you
      will admit is not likely to prejudice me in his favor&mdash;is that he is
      mayor of this town and has a furniture store&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A manufactory; it is a very large business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, manufactory, then; all the same he is not a brilliant match
      for my daughter, not such a husband as your sisters have.&rdquo; Esther's lip
      quivered and her color rose again; but she did not speak. &ldquo;Still I will
      say that I think a fellow who can make his own fortune is better than a
      man with twice that fortune made for him. My dear, if Lossing has the
      right stuff in him and he is a real good fellow, I shan't make you go into
      a decline by objecting; but you see it is a big shock to me, and you must
      let me get used to it, and let me size the young man up in my own way.
      There is another thing, Esther; I am going to Europe Thursday, that will
      give me just a day in Chicago if I go to-morrow, and I wish you would come
      with me. Will you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either she changed her seat or she started at the proposal. But how could
      she say that she wanted to stay in America with a man who had not said a
      formal word of love to her? &ldquo;I can get ready, I think, papa,&rdquo; said Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove on. He felt a crawling pain in his heart, for he loved his
      daughter Esther as he had loved no other child of his; and he knew that he
      had hurt her. Naturally, he grew the more angry at the impertinent young
      man who was the cause of the flitting; for the whole European plan had
      been cooked up since the receipt of Mrs. Ellis's letter. They were on the
      very street down which he used to walk (for it takes the line of the
      hills) when he was a poor boy, a struggling, ferociously ambitious young
      man. He looked at the changed rows of buildings, and other thoughts came
      uppermost for a moment. &ldquo;It was here father's church used to stand; it's
      gone, now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a wood church, painted a kind of gray; mother
      had a bonnet the same color, and she used to say she matched the church. I
      bought it with the very first money I earned. Part of it came from
      weeding, and the weather was warm, and I can feel the way my back would
      sting and creak, now! I would want to stop, often, but I thought of mother
      in church with that bonnet, and I kept on! There's the place where Seeds,
      the grocer that used to trust us, had his store; it was his children had
      the scarlet fever, and mother went to nurse them. My! but how dismal it
      was at home! We always got more whippings when mother was away. Your
      grandfather was a good man, too honest for this world, and he loved every
      one of his seven children; but he brought us up to fear him and the Lord.
      We feared him the most, because the Lord couldn't whip us! He never
      whipped us when we did anything, but waited until next day, that he might
      not punish in anger; so we had all the night to anticipate it. Did I ever
      tell you of the time he caught me in a lie? I was lame for a week after
      it. He never caught me in another lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was cruel; I can't help it, papa,&rdquo; cried Esther, with whom
      this was an old argument, &ldquo;still it did good, that time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, he wasn't cruel, my dear,&rdquo; said Armorer, with a queer smile that
      seemed to take only one-half of his face, not answering the last words;
      &ldquo;he was too sure of his interpretation of the Scripture, that was all.
      Why, that man just slaved to educate us children; he'd have gone to the
      stake rejoicing to have made sure that we should be saved. And of the
      whole seven only one is a church member. Is that the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could see a car swinging past, on a parallel street, its bent pole
      hitching along the trolley-wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty scrubby-looking cars,&rdquo; commented Armorer; &ldquo;but get our new
      ordinance through the council, we can save enough to afford some fine new
      cars. Has Lossing said anything to you about the ordinance and our
      petition to be allowed to leave off the conductors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't said anything, but I read about it in the papers. Is it so very
      important that it should be passed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saving money is always important, my dear,&rdquo; said Armorer, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses turned again. They were now opposite a fair lawn and a house of
      wood and stone built after the old colonial pattern, as modern architects
      see it. Esther pointed, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Meg's, papa; isn't it pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very handsome, very fine,&rdquo; said the financier, who knew nothing about
      architecture, except its exceeding expense. &ldquo;Esther, I've a notion; if
      that young man of yours has brains and is fond of you he ought to be able
      to get my ordinance through his little eight by ten city council. There is
      our chance to see what stuff he is made of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has a great deal of influence,&rdquo; said Esther; &ldquo;he can do it, unless&mdash;unless
      he thinks the ordinance would be bad for the city, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the modern way of educating girls!&rdquo; thought Armorer. &ldquo;Now, it
      would have been enough for Esther's mother to know that anything was for
      my interests; it wouldn't have to help all out-doors, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But instead of enlarging on this point, he went into a sketch of the
      improvements the road could make with the money saved by the change, and
      was waxing eloquent when a lady of a pleasant and comely face, and a trig
      though not slender figure, advanced to greet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after breakfast (and the scene was the neat pig's pen, where
      Armorer was displaying his ignorance of swine) that he found his first
      chance to talk with his sister alone. &ldquo;Oh, first, Sis,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;about
      your birthday, to-day; I telegraphed to Tiffany's for that silver service,
      you know, that you liked, so you needn't think there's a mistake when it
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, 'Raish, that gorgeous thing! I must kiss you, if Daniel does see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; said Armorer, hastily, and began to talk of the
      pig. Suddenly, without looking up, he dropped into the pig-pen the remark:
      &ldquo;I'm very much obliged to you for writing me, Meg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether to feel more like a virtuous sister or a villanous
      aunt,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Ellis; &ldquo;things seemed to be getting on so rapidly that
      it didn't seem right, Esther visiting me and all, not to give you a hint;
      still, I am sure that nothing has been said, and it is horrid for Esther,
      perfectly HORRID, discussing her proposals that haven't been proposed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want them ever to be proposed,&rdquo; said Armorer, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you always said you didn't want Esther to marry; but I thought if
      she fell in love with the right man&mdash;we know that marriage is a very
      happy estate, sometimes, Horatio!&rdquo; She sighed again. In her case it was
      only the memory of happiness, for Colonel Ellis had been dead these twelve
      years; but his widow mourned him still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you marry the right one, maybe,&rdquo; answered Armorer, grudgingly; &ldquo;but
      see here, Meg, Esther is different from the other girls; they got married
      when Jenny was alive to look after them, and I knew the men, and they were
      both big matches, you know. Then, too, I was so busy making money while
      the other girls grew up that I hadn't time to get real well acquainted
      with them. I don't think they ever kissed me, except when I gave them a
      check. But Esther and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he drummed with his fingers on the
      boards, his thin, keen face wearing a look that would have amazed his
      business acquaintances&mdash;&ldquo;you remember when her mother died, Meg? Only
      fifteen, and how she took hold of things! And we have been together ever
      since, and she makes me think of her grandmother and her mother both.
      She's never had a wish I knew that I haven't granted&mdash;why, d&mdash;&mdash;
      it! I've bought my clothes to please her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why you are become so well-dressed, Horatio; I wondered how you
      came to spruce up so!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Ellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been so blamed lonesome whenever she went to visit you, but yet I
      wouldn't say a word because I knew what a good time she had; but if I had
      known that there was a confounded, long-legged, sniffy young idiot all
      that while trying to steal my daughter away from me!&rdquo; In an access of
      wrath at the idea Armorer wrenched off the picket that he clutched, at
      which he laughed and stuck his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Meg, the papers and magazines are always howling that women won't
      marry,&rdquo; cried he, with a fresh sense of grievance; &ldquo;now, two of my girls
      have married, that's enough; there was no reason for me to expect any more
      of them would! There isn't one d&mdash;&mdash; bit of need for Esther to
      marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she loves the young fellow and he loves her, won't you let them be
      happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't make her happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very good fellow, truly and really, 'Raish. And he comes of a
      good family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for his family; and as to his being moral and all that, I
      know several young fellows that could skin him alive in a bargain that are
      moral as you please. I have been a moral man, myself. But the trouble with
      this Lossing (I told Esther I didn't know anything about him, but I do),
      the trouble with him is that he is chock full of all kinds of principles!
      Just as father was. Don't you remember how he lost parish after parish
      because he couldn't smooth over the big men in them? Lossing is every bit
      as pig-headed. I am not going to have my daughter lead the kind of life my
      mother did. I want a son-in-law who ain't going to think himself so much
      better than I am, and be rowing me for my way of doing business. If Esther
      MUST marry I'd like her to marry a man with a head on him that I can take
      into business, and who will be willing to live with the old man. This
      Lossing has got his notions of making a sort of Highland chief affair of
      the labor question, and we should get along about as well as the Kilkenny
      cats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis knew more than Esther about Armorer's business methods, having
      the advantage of her husband's point of view; and Colonel Ellis had kept
      the army standard of honor as well as the army ignorance of business. To
      counterbalance, she knew more than anyone alive what a good son and
      brother Horatio had always been. But she could not restrain a smile at the
      picture of the partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, you see yourself,&rdquo; said Armorer. &ldquo;Meg&rdquo;&mdash;hesitating&mdash;&ldquo;you
      don't suppose it would be any use to offer Esther a cool hundred thousand
      to promise to bounce this young fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horatio, NO!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Ellis, tossing her pretty gray head indignantly;
      &ldquo;you'd insult her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it the same way, eh? Well, perhaps; Essie has high-toned notions.
      That's all right, it is the thing for women. Mother had them too. Look
      here, Meg, I'll tell you, I want to see if this young fellow has ANY
      sense! We have an ordinance that we want passed. If he will get his
      council to pass it, that will show he can put his grand theories into his
      pockets sometimes; and I will give him a show with Esther. If he doesn't
      care enough for my girl to oblige her father, even if he doesn't please a
      lot of carping roosters that want the earth for their town and would like
      a street railway to be run to accommodate them and lose money for the
      stockholders, well, then, you can't blame me if I don't want him! Now,
      will you do one thing for me, Meg, to help me out? I don't want Lossing to
      persuade Esther to commit herself; you know how, when she was a little
      mite, if Esther gave her word she kept it. I want you to promise me you
      won't let Esther be alone one second with young Lossing. She is going
      to-morrow, but there's your whist-party to-night; I suppose he's coming?
      And I want you to promise you won't let him have our address. If he treats
      me square, he won't need to ask you for it. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He buttoned up his coat and folded his arms, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis's sympathy had gone out to the young people as naturally as
      water runs down hill; for she is of a romantic temperament, though she
      doesn't dare to be weighed. But she remembered the silver service, the
      coffee-pot, the tea-pot, the tray for spoons, the creamer, the hot-water
      kettle, the sugar-bowl, all on a rich salver, splendid, dazzling; what
      rank ingratitude it would be to oppose her generous brother! Rather sadly
      she answered, but she did answer: &ldquo;I'll do that much for you, 'Raish, but
      I feel we're risking Esther's happiness, and I can only keep the letter of
      my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all I ask, my dear,&rdquo; said Armorer, taking out a little shabby
      note-book from his breast-pocket, and scratching out a line. The line
      effaced read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>See E &amp; M tea-set</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The silver service was a good muzzle,&rdquo; he thought. He went away for an
      interview with the corporation lawyer and the superintendent of the road,
      leaving Mrs. Ellis in a distraction of conscience that made her the wonder
      of her servants that morning, during all the preparations for the
      whist-party. She might have felt more remorseful had she guessed her
      brother's real plan. He knew enough of Lossing to be assured that he would
      not yield about the ordinance, which he firmly believed to be a dangerous
      one for the city. He expected, he counted on the mayor's refusing his
      proffers. He hoped that Esther would feel the sympathy which women give,
      without question generally, to the business plans of those near and dear
      to them, taking it for granted that the plans are right because they will
      advantage those so near and dear. That was the beautiful and proper way
      that Jenny had always reasoned; why should Jenny's daughter do otherwise?
      When Harry Lossing should oppose her father and refuse to please him and
      to win her, mustn't any high-spirited woman feel hurt? Certainly she must;
      and he would take care to whisk her off to Europe before the young man had
      a chance to make his peace! &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; says Armorer, to his only
      confidant, &ldquo;you never were a domestic conspirator before, Horatio, but you
      have got it down fine! You would do for Gaboriau&rdquo;&mdash;Gaboriau's novels
      being the only fiction that ever Armorer read. Nevertheless, his
      conscience pricked him almost as sharply as his sister's pricked her.
      Consciences are queer things; like certain crustaceans, they grow shells
      in spots; and, proof against moral artillery in one part, they may be soft
      as a baby's cheek in another. Armorer's conscience had two sides, business
      and domestic; people abused him for a business buccaneer, at the same time
      his private life was pure, and he was a most tender husband and father. He
      had never deceived Esther before in her life. Once he had ridden all night
      in a freight-car to keep a promise that he had made the child. It hurt him
      to be hoodwinking her now. But he was too angry and too frightened to cry
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview with the lawyer did not take any long time, but he spent two
      hours with the superintendent of the road, who pronounced him &ldquo;a little
      nice fellow with no airs about him. Asked a power of questions about Harry
      Lossing; guess there is something in that story about Lossing going to
      marry his daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston drove him to Lossing's office and left him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on the ground, and Marston lifting the whip to touch the horse,
      when he asked: &ldquo;Say, before you go&mdash;is there any danger in leaving
      off the conductors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston was raised on mules, and he could not overcome a vehement distrust
      of electricity. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I guess you want the cold facts. The
      children are almighty thick down on Third Street, and children are always
      trying to see how near they can come to being killed, you know, sir; and
      then, the old women like to come and stand on the track and ask questions
      of the motorneer on the other track, so that the car coming down has a
      chance to catch 'em. The two together keep the conductors on the jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said Armorer, musingly; &ldquo;well, I guess you'd better close
      with that insurance man and get the papers made out before we run the new
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we ever do run!&rdquo; muttered the superintendent to himself as he drove
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armorer ran his sharp eye over the buildings of the Lossing Art Furniture
      Manufacturing Company, from the ugly square brick box that was the nucleus&mdash;the
      egg, so to speak&mdash;from which the great concern had been hatched, to
      the handsome new structures with their great arched windows and red
      mortar. &ldquo;Pretty property, very pretty property,&rdquo; thought Armorer; &ldquo;wonder
      if that story Marston tells is true!&rdquo; The story was to the effect that a
      few weeks before his last sickness the older Lossing had taken his son to
      look at the buildings, and said, &ldquo;Harry, this will all be yours before
      long. It is a comfort to me to think that every workman I have is the
      better, not the worse, off for my owning it; there's no blood or dirt on
      my money; and I leave it to you to keep it clean and to take care of the
      men as well as the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, wasn't he a d&mdash;&mdash; fool!&rdquo; said Armorer, cheerfully, taking
      out his note-book to mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>See abt road M&mdash;D&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went in. Harry greeted him with exceeding cordiality and a fine
      blush. Armorer explained that he had come to speak to him about the
      proposed street-car ordinances; he (Armorer) always liked to deal with
      principals and without formality; now, couldn't they come, representing
      the city and the company, to some satisfactory compromise? Thereupon he
      plunged into the statistics of the earnings and expenses of the road (with
      the aid of his note-book), and made the absolute necessity of retrenchment
      plain. Meanwhile, as he talked he studied the attentive listener before
      him; and Harry, on his part, made quite as good use of his eyes. Armorer
      saw a tall, athletic, fair young man, very carefully, almost foppishly
      dressed, with bright, steady blue eyes and a firm chin, but a smile under
      his mustache like a child's; it was so sunny and so quick. Harry saw a
      neat little figure in a perfectly fitting gray check travelling suit, with
      a rose in the buttonhole of the coat lapel. Armorer wore no jewellery
      except a gold ring on the little finger of his right hand, from which he
      had taken the glove the better to write. Harry knew that it was his dead
      wife's wedding-ring; and noticed it with a little moving of the heart. The
      face that he saw was pale but not sickly, delicate and keen. A silky brown
      mustache shot with gray and a Van-dyke beard hid either the strength or
      the weakness of mouth and chin. He looked at Harry with almond-shaped,
      pensive dark eyes, so like the eyes that had shone on Harry's waking and
      sleeping dreams for months that the young fellow felt his heart rise
      again. Armorer ended by asking Harry (in his most winning manner) to help
      him pull the ordinance out of the fire. &ldquo;It would be,&rdquo; he said,
      impressively, &ldquo;a favor he should not forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must know, Mr. Armorer,&rdquo; said Harry, in a dismal tone at which
      the president chuckled within, &ldquo;that there is no man whose favor I would
      do so much to win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's your chance!&rdquo; said Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry swung round in his chair, his clinched fists on his knee. He was
      frowning with eagerness, and his eyes were like blue steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Mr. Armorer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am frank with you. I want to please
      you, because I want to ask you to let me marry your daughter. But I CAN'T
      please you, because I am mayor of this town, and I don't dare to let you
      dismiss the conductors. I don't DARE, that's the point. We have had four
      children killed on this road since electricity was put in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had forty killed on one street railway I know; what of it? Do you
      want to give up electricity because it kills children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but look here! the conductors lessen the risk. A lady I know, only
      yesterday, had a little boy going from the kindergarten home, nice little
      fellow only five years old&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to have sent a nurse with a child five years old, a baby!&rdquo;
       cried Armorer, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lady,&rdquo; answered Harry, quietly, &ldquo;goes without any servant at all in
      order to keep her two children at the kindergarten; and the boy's elder
      sister was ill at home. The boy got on the car, and when he got off at the
      crossing above his house, he started to run across; the other train-car
      was coming, the little fellow didn't notice, and ran to cross; he stumbled
      and fell right in the path of the coming car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was the conductor? He didn't seem much good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had left off the conductor on that line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did they run over the boy? Why haven't I been informed of the
      accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no accident. A man on the front platform saw the boy fall, made
      a flying leap off the moving car, fell, but scrambled up and pulled the
      boy off the track. It was sickening; I thought we were both gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the man; and don't you see, Mr. Armorer, why I feel strongly on the
      subject? If the conductor had been on, there wouldn't have been any
      occasion for any accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you may be assured that we will take precautions against any
      such accidents. It is more for our interest than anyone's to guard against
      them. And I have explained to you the necessity of cutting down our
      expense list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just it, you think you have to risk our lives to cut down
      expenses; but we get all the risk and none of the benefits. I can't see my
      way clear to helping you, sir; I wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is nothing more to say, Mr. Lossing,&rdquo; said Armorer, coldly.
      &ldquo;I'm sorry a mere sentiment that has no real foundation should stand in
      the way of our arranging a deal that would be for the advantage of both
      the city and our road.&rdquo; He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry rose also, but lifted his hand to arrest the financier. &ldquo;Pardon me,
      there is something else; I wouldn't mention it, but I hear you are going
      to leave to-morrow and go abroad with&mdash;Miss Armorer. I am conscious I
      haven't introduced myself very favorably, by refusing you a favor when I
      want to ask the greatest one possible; but I hope, sir, you will not think
      the less of a man because he is not willing to sacrifice the interests of
      the people who trust him, to please ANYONE. I&mdash;I hope you will not
      object to my asking Miss Armorer to marry me,&rdquo; concluded Harry, very hot
      and shaky, and forgetting the beginning of his sentences before he came to
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my daughter love you, do I understand, Mr. Lossing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir. I wish I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Lossing,&rdquo; said Armorer, wishing that something in the young
      man's confusion would not remind him of the awful moment when he asked old
      Forrester for his Jenny, &ldquo;I am afraid I can do nothing for you. If you
      have too nice a conscience to oblige me, I am afraid it will be too nice
      to let you get on in the world. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;if it is only my ability to get on in the
      world that is the trouble, I think&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your love for my daughter,&rdquo; said Armorer; &ldquo;if you don't love her
      enough to give up a sentimental notion for her, to win her, I don't see
      but you must lose her, I bid you good-morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite yet, sir&rdquo;&mdash;Harry jumped before the door; &ldquo;you give me the
      alternative of being what I call dishonorable or losing the woman I love!&rdquo;
       He pronounced the last word with a little effort and his lips closed
      sharply as his teeth shut under them. &ldquo;Well, I decline the alternative. I
      shall try to do my duty and get the wife I want, BOTH.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you give me fair warning, don't you?&rdquo; said Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry held out his hand, saying, &ldquo;I am sorry that I detained you. I didn't
      mean to be rude.&rdquo; There was something boyish and simple about the action
      and the tone, and Armorer laughed. As Harry attended him through the outer
      office to the door, he complimented the shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Armorer and Mrs. Ellis have promised to give me the pleasure of
      showing them to them this afternoon,&rdquo; said Harry; &ldquo;can't I show them and
      part of our city to you, also? It has changed a good deal since you left
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark threw Armorer off his balance; for a rejected suitor this young
      man certainly kept an even mind. But he had all the helplessness of the
      average American with regard to his daughter's amusements. The humor in
      the situation took him; and it cannot be denied that he began to have a
      vivid curiosity about Harry. In less time than it takes to read it, his
      mind had swung round the circle of these various points of view, and he
      had blandly accepted Harry's invitation. But he mopped a warm and furrowed
      brow, outside, and drew a prodigious sigh as he opened the note-book in
      his hand and crossed out, &ldquo;<i>See L.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;That young fellow ain't all
      conscience,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not by a long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found Mrs. Ellis very apologetic about the Lossing engagement. It was
      made through the telephone; Esther had been anxious to have her father
      meet Lossing; Lossing was to drive them there, and later show Mr. Armorer
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lossing is a very clever young man, very,&rdquo; said Armorer, gravely, as
      he went out to smoke his cigar after luncheon. He wished he had stayed,
      however, when he returned to find that a visitor had called, and that this
      visitor was the mother of the little boy that Harry Lossing had saved from
      the car. The two women gave him the accident in full, and were lavish of
      harrowing detail, including the mother's feelings. &ldquo;So you see, 'Raish,&rdquo;
       urged Mrs. Ellis, timidly, &ldquo;there is some reason for opposition to the
      ordinance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Esther's cheeks were red and her eyes shone, but she had not spoken. Her
      father put his arm around her waist and kissed her hair. &ldquo;And what did you
      say, Essie,&rdquo; he asked, gently, &ldquo;to all the criticisms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her I thought you would find some way to protect the children even
      if the conductors were taken off; you didn't enjoy the slaughter of
      children any more than anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we can fix it. Here is your young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry drove a pair of spirited horses. He drove well, and looked both
      handsome and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know that lady&mdash;the mother of the boy that wasn't run over&mdash;was
      coming to see my sister?&rdquo; said Armorer, on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I sent her; I thought she could explain the reason
      why I shall have to oppose the bill, better than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the shops he kept his eye on the young man. Harry seemed to know most
      of his workmen, and had a nod or a word for all the older men. He stopped
      several moments to talk with one old German who complained of everything,
      but looked after Harry with a smile, nodding his head. &ldquo;That man, Lieders,
      is our best workman; you can't get any better work in the country,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I want you to see an armoire that he has carved, it is up in our
      exhibition room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer said, &ldquo;You seem to get on very well with your working people, Mr.
      Lossing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we generally get on well with them, and they do well themselves,
      in these Western towns. For one thing, we haven't much organization to
      fight, and for another thing, the individual workman has a better chance
      to rise. That man Lieders, whom you saw, is worth a good many thousand
      dollars; my father invested his savings for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of the philanthropists, aren't you, Mr. Lossing, who are
      trying to elevate the laboring classes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, sir. I shall never try to elevate the laboring classes;
      it is too big a contract. But I try as hard as I know how to have every
      man who has worked for Harry Lossing the better for it. I don't concern
      myself with any other laboring men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a murmur of exclamations came from Mrs. Ellis and Esther, whom
      the superintendent was piloting through the shops. &ldquo;Oh, no, it is too
      heavy; oh, don't do it, Mr. Cardigan!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, we can see it perfectly well
      from here! PLEASE don't, you will break yourself somewhere!&rdquo; Mrs. Ellis
      shrieked this; but the shrieks turned to a murmur of admiration as a huge
      carved sideboard came bobbing and wobbling, like an intoxicated piece of
      furniture in a haunted house, toward the two gentlewomen. Immediately, a
      short but powerfully built man, whose red face beamed above his dusty
      shoulders like a full moon with a mustache, emerged, and waved his hand at
      the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could tackle the two of them, begging your pardon, ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Cardigan,&rdquo; explained Harry, &ldquo;Miss Armorer may have told you about
      him. Oh, SHUEY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cardigan approached and was presented. He brought both his heels together
      and bowed solemnly, bending his head at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, sir,&rdquo; said Shuey. Then he assumed an attitude of
      military attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take us up in the elevator, will you, Shuey?&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Step in, Mr.
      Armorer, please, we will go and see the reproductions of the antique; we
      have a room upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Armorer stepped in, Shuey following; and then, before Harry could
      enter it, the elevator shot upward and&mdash;stuck!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; cried Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shuey was tugging at the wire rope. He called, in tones that seemed to
      come from a panting chest: &ldquo;Take a pull at it yourself, sir! Can you move
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer grasped the rope viciously; Shuey was on the seat pulling from
      above. &ldquo;We're stuck, sir, fast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you get down either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divil a bit, saving your presence, sir. Do ye think like the water-works
      could be busted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you make somebody hear?&rdquo; panted Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see there's a deal of noise of the machinery,&rdquo; said Shuey,
      scratching his chin with a thoughtful air, &ldquo;and they expect we've gone
      up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best try, anyhow. This infernal machine may take a notion to drop!&rdquo; said
      Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's true, too,&rdquo; acquiesced Shuey. Forthwith he did lift up his
      voice in a loud wailing: &ldquo;OH&mdash;H, Jimmy! OH&mdash;H, Jimmy Ryan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy might have been in Chicago for any response he made; though Armorer
      shouted with Shuey; and at every pause the whir of the machinery mocked
      the shouters. Indescribable moans and gurgles, with a continuous malignant
      hiss, floated up to them from the rebel steam below, as from a volcano
      considering eruption. &ldquo;They'll be bound to need the elevator some time, if
      they don't need US, and that's one comfort!&rdquo; said Shuey, philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think if we pulled on her we could get her up to the next
      floor, by degrees? Now then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer gave a dash and Shuey let out his muscles in a giant tug. The
      elevator responded by an astonishing leap that carried them past three or
      four floors!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop her! stop her!&rdquo; bawled Shuey; but in spite of Armorer's pulling
      himself purple in the face, the elevator did not stop until it bumped with
      a crash against the joists of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you suppose we're stuck HERE?&rdquo; growled Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I'll try. Say, don't be exerting yourself violent. It strikes
      me she's for all the world like the wimmen,&mdash;in exthremes, sir, in
      exthremes! And it wouldn't be noways so pleasant to go riproaring that
      gait down cellar! Slow and easy, sir, let me manage her. Hi! she's
      working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, by slow degrees and much puffing, Shuey got the erratic box to
      the next floor, where, disregarding Shuey's protestations that he could
      &ldquo;make her mind,&rdquo; Mr. Armorer got out, and they left the elevator to its
      fate. It was a long way, through many rooms, downstairs. Shuey would have
      beguiled the way by describing the rooms, but Armorer was in a raging
      hurry and urged his guide over the ground. Once they were delayed by a
      bundle of stuff in front of a door; and after Shuey had laboriously rolled
      the great roll away, he made a misstep and tumbled over, rolling it back,
      to a tittering accompaniment from the sewing-girls in the room. But he
      picked himself up in perfect good temper and kicked the roll ten yards.
      &ldquo;Girls is silly things,&rdquo; said the philosopher Shuey, &ldquo;but being born that
      way it ain't to be expected otherwise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the friendly freedom of his class in the West. He praised Mrs.
      Ellis's gymnastics, and urged Armorer to stay over a morning train and see
      a &ldquo;real pretty boxing match&rdquo; between Mr. Lossing and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he boxes too, does he?&rdquo; said Armorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why on earth would he groan-like?&rdquo; wondered Shuey to himself. &ldquo;He
      does that, sir,&rdquo; he continued aloud; &ldquo;didn't Mrs. Ellis ever tell you
      about the time at the circus? She was there herself, with three children
      she borrowed and an unreasonable gyurl, with a terrible big screech in her
      and no sense. Yes, sir, Mr. Lossing he is mighty cliver with his hands!
      There come a yell of 'Lion loose! lion loose!' at that circus, just as the
      folks was all crowding out at the end of it, and them that had gone into
      the menagerie tent came a-tumbling and howling back, and them that was in
      the circus tent waiting for the concert (which never ain't worth waiting
      for, between you and me!) was a-scrambling off them seats, making a noise
      like thunder; and all fighting and pushing and bellowing to get out! I was
      there with my wife and making for the seats that the fools quit, so's to
      get under and crawl out under the canvas, when I see Mrs. Ellis holding
      two of the children, and that fool girl let the other go and I grabbed it.
      'Oh, save the baby! save one, anyhow,' cries my wife&mdash;the woman is a
      tinder-hearted crechure! And just then I seen an old lady tumble over on
      the benches, with her gray hair stringing out of her black bonnet. The
      crowd was WILD, hitting and screaming and not caring for anything, and I
      see a big jack of a man come plunging down right spang on that old lady!
      His foot was right in the air over her face! Lord, it turned me sick. I
      yelled. But that minnit I seen an arm shoot out and that fellow shot off
      as slick! it was Mr. Lossing. He parted that crowd, hitting right and
      left, and he got up to us and hauled a child from Mrs. Ellis and put it on
      the seats, all the while shouting: 'Keep your seats! it's all right! it's
      all over! stand back!' I turned and floored a feller that was too
      pressing, and hollered it was all right too. And some more people hollered
      too. You see, there is just a minnit at such times when it is a toss up
      whether folks will quiet down and begin to laugh, or get scared into wild
      beasts and crush and kill each other. And Mr. Lossing he caught the
      minnit! The circus folks came up and the police, and it was all over.
      WELL, just look here, sir; there's our folks coming out of the elevator!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were just landing; and Mrs. Ellis wanted to know where he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We run away from ye, shure,&rdquo; said Shuey, grinning; and he related the
      adventure. Armorer fell back with Mrs. Ellis. &ldquo;Did you stay with Esther
      every minute?&rdquo; said he. Mrs. Ellis nodded. She opened her lips to speak,
      then closed them and walked ahead to Harry Lossing. Armorer looked&mdash;suspicion
      of a dozen kinds gnawing him and insinuating that the three all seemed
      agitated&mdash;from Harry to Esther, and then to Shuey. But he kept his
      thoughts to himself and was very agreeable the remainder of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Harry tell Mrs. Ellis that the city council would meet that
      evening; before, however, Armorer could feel exultant he added, &ldquo;but may I
      come late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is certainly the coolest beggar,&rdquo; Armorer snarled, &ldquo;but he is sharp as
      a nigger's razor, confound him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally this remark was a confidential one to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it more times than one during the evening, and by consequence
      played trumps with equal disregard of the laws of the noble game of whist
      and his partner's feelings. He found a few, a very few, elderly people who
      remembered his parent, and they will never believe ill of Horatio Armorer,
      who talked so simply and with so much feeling of old times, and who is
      going to give a memorial window in the new Presbyterian church. He was
      beginning to think with some interest of supper, the usual dinner of the
      family having been sacrificed to the demands of state; then he saw Harry
      Lossing. The young mayor's blond head was bowing before his sister's black
      velvet. He caught Armorer's eye and followed him out to the lawn and the
      shadows and the gay lanterns. He looked animated. Evening dress was
      becoming to him. &ldquo;One of my daughters married a prince, but I am hanged if
      he looked it like this fellow,&rdquo; thought Armorer; &ldquo;but then he was only an
      Italian. I suppose the council did not pass the ordinance? your committee
      reported against it?&rdquo; he said quite amicably to Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could understand how much pain it has given me to oppose you,
      Mr. Armorer,&rdquo; said Harry, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't doubt it, under the circumstances, Mr. Lossing.&rdquo; Armorer spoke
      with suave politeness, but there was a cynical gleam in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Esther understands,&rdquo; says Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Esther!&rdquo; repeats Armorer, with an indescribable intonation. &ldquo;You spoke to
      her this afternoon? For a man with such high-toned ideas as you carry, I
      think you took a pretty mean advantage of your guests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember I gave you fair warning, Mr. Armorer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was while I was in the elevator, of course. I guessed it was a put-up
      job; how did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry smiled outright; he is one who cannot keep either his dog or his
      joke tied up. &ldquo;It was Shuey did it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he pulled the opposite way
      from you, and he has tremendous strength; but he says you were a handful
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have taken the town into your confidence,&rdquo; said Armorer,
      bitterly, though he had a sneaking inclination to laugh himself; &ldquo;do you
      need all your workmen to help you court your girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd take the whole United States into my confidence rather than lose her,
      sir,&rdquo; answered Harry, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armorer turned on his heel abruptly; it was to conceal a smile. &ldquo;How about
      my sister? did you propose before her? But I don't suppose a little thing
      like that would stop you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to speak; Miss Armorer goes away tomorrow. Mrs. Ellis was kind
      enough to put her fingers in her ears and turn her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did my daughter say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her only to give me the chance to show her how I loved her, and
      she has. God bless her! I don't pretend I'm worthy of her, Mr. Armorer,
      but I have lived a decent life, and I'll try hard to live a better one for
      her trust in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad there is one thing on which we are agreed,&rdquo; jeered Armorer, &ldquo;but
      you are more modest than you were this noon. I think it was considerably
      like bragging, sending that woman to tell of your heroic feats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can brag when it is necessary,&rdquo; said Harry, serenely; &ldquo;what would
      the West be but for bragging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you intend to do if I take your girl to Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Europe is not very far,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armorer was a quick thinker, but he had never thought more quickly in his
      life. This young fellow had beaten him. There was no doubt of it. He might
      have principles, but he declined to let his principles hamper him. There
      was something about Harry's waving aside defeat so lightly, and so swiftly
      snatching at every chance to forward his will, that accorded with
      Armorer's own temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Mr. Armorer,&rdquo; said Harry, suddenly; &ldquo;in my place wouldn't you
      have done the same thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armorer no longer checked his sense of humor. &ldquo;No, Mr. Lossing,&rdquo; he
      answered, sedately, &ldquo;I should have respected the old gentleman's wishes
      and voted any way he pleased.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;I guess Esther
      thinks you are the coming young man of the century; and to be honest, I
      like you a great deal better than I expected to this morning. I'm not cut
      out for a cruel father, Mr. Lossing; for one thing, I haven't the time for
      it; for another thing, I can't bear to have my little girl cry. I guess I
      shall have to go to Europe without Esther. Shall we go in to the ladies
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry wrung the president's hand, crying that he should never regret his
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that Esther never regrets it, that will be better,&rdquo; said Armorer,
      with a touch of real and deep feeling. Then, as Harry sprang up the steps
      like a boy, he took out the note-book, and smiling a smile in which many
      emotions were blended, he ran a black line through
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>See abt L.</i>&rdquo;

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
